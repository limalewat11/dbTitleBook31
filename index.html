It should be an idyllic trip, yet Poirot has a vague, uneasy feeling that something is dangerously amiss...<br><br></p><p>Hercule Poirot is perhaps Agatha Christie's most interesting and endearing character; short, round, and slightly comical, Poirot has a razor-sharp mind and puts unlimited trust in his "little grey cells." Those little cells come through for him every time, enabling Poirot to solve some of the most baffling mysteries ever conceived. In <i>Death on the Nile</i>, Poirot, on vacation in Africa, meets the rich, beautiful Linnet Doyle and her new husband, Simon. As usual, all is not as it seems between the newlyweds, and when Linnet is found murdered, Poirot must sort through a boatload of suspects to find the killer before he (or she) strikes again.Agatha Christie's genius for detective fiction is unparalleled. Her worldwide popularity is phenomenal, her characters engaging, her plots spellbinding. No one knows the human heart--or the dark passions that can stop it--better than Agatha Christie. She is truly the one and only Queen of Crime.<br>Linnet Doyle is young, beautiful, and rich. She's the girl who has everything--including the man her best friend loves.

Anne Bradstreet is known for her poem, &#34;To My Dear and Loving Husband,&#34; among others, and through John Berryman&#39;s &#34;Homage to Mistress Bradstreet.&#34; With her first collection, The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, she became the first published poet, male or female, of the New World. Many New England towns were founded and settled by Anne Bradstreet&#39;s family or their close associates--characters who appear in these pages.</p><p>*Starred Review* The first American best-seller was a book of poems by one of Massachusetts' Puritan founders, Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612-72), favorite daughter of first deputy governor Thomas Dudley and wife of future governor Simon Bradstreet. Gordon discovered Bradstreet when, in her first high-school gig, she had to teach a unit on early American literature and found that the colonial woman's subject matter--the domestic life of a pioneer and the political and religious issues and events of turbulent seventeenth-century England and its colonies--captivated her and, mirabile dictu, her students, too. Here, while she gives Bradstreet's prosodic skill its due, she really expatiates on Bradstreet's life, extrapolating its content and texture not only from Bradstreet's personally reticent writings (no journal or diary is among them) and those of her influential father, his associates, including first Massachusetts governor John Winthrop, and other friends of the Dudley family but also from documentation and research of the techniques of living in Bradstreet's England and Massachusetts--house-building and -keeping, emigration and trade by sea, founding new towns (fortunately, the colonizers already constituted a strong community), childbearing and -rearing, gardening and farming, and social organization and relations with cultural others (Native Americans and French). Written with maximal clarity and communicativeness, this is a vibrant, engaging, realistic portrayal of early colonial Massachusetts and of its fascinating biographical subject. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>When Anne Bradstreet (1612?-1672) published her first book of poetry, <i>The Tenth Muse,</i> in 1650, she called it the "ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain." Yet, as poet Gordon (<i>Two Girls on a Raft</i>) demonstrates in this plodding and unilluminating biography, Bradstreet uttered those words more out of self-defense than regret. From her adolescence to the publication of her book, the Puritan poet viewed her work as a vocation that enabled her to worship God in vivid homespun images and to express sometimes complex theological ideas in plain language. Gordon depicts Bradstreet as a woman of her time, required to submit to her father and husband in religious and social matters. Gordon demonstrates that Bradstreet nevertheless benefited from the privileges of a literary education. Her family's social and religious circle included the most important figures of the early 17th century, from John Winthrop to Roger Williams. While her book was very popular at its publication, Bradstreet's reputation waned after the Civil War, to be recovered in the 20th century by her influence on poets such as Anne Sexton and John Berryman. Regrettably, Gordon's wearisome focus on the well-known facts of Bradstreet's upbringing leaves little room for a significant exploration of her poetic life and works. 8 pages of b&amp;w illus. not seen by <i>PW.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Most woodworking titles continue to show a combination of hand-tool and machine techniques, which does not reflect the way many people really work. Chan, a furniture maker, designer, and teacher who studied under James Krenov at the College of the Redwoods, shows readers how to create a vast array of wood joints using just machines (though some do require a little handwork). He describes a number of the most commonly used woodworking machines (the table saw, band saw, router, drill, mortiser, and biscuit joiner) and provides information for building several jigs that would increase both accuracy and safety. The joints range from easy (butt joints) to esoteric (mitered lap with small tenon); the one common element is the outstanding instructions, illustrations, and colorful photos. Another nice feature is that a number of joints that can be made using a common technique (such as doweling) are shown together so that mastery of one process can allow for many applications. This title will be useful to woodworkers of all skill levels and should be part of most public library collections. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism</h2><p>&#x201c;Liberals&#x2019; loyalty to the United States is off-limits as a subject of political debate. Why is the relative patriotism of the two parties the only issue that is out of bounds for rational discussion?&#x201d;<br><br>In a stunning follow-up to her number one bestseller <b>Slander</b>, leading conservative pundit Ann Coulter contends that liberals have been wrong on every foreign policy issue, from the fight against Communism at home and abroad, the Nixon and the Clinton presidencies, and the struggle with the Soviet empire right up to today&#x2019;s war on terrorism. &#x201c;Liberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,&#x201d; says Coulter. &#x201c;Everyone says liberals love America, too. No, they don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; From Truman to Kennedy to Carter to Clinton, America has contained, appeased, and retreated, often sacrificing America&#x2019;s best interests and security. With the fate of the world in the balance, liberals should leave the defense of the nation to conservatives.<br><br>Reexamining the sixty-year history of the Cold War and beyond&#x2014;including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers&#x2013;Alger Hiss affair, Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to &#x201c;tear down this wall,&#x201d; the Gulf War, and our present war on terrorism&#x2014;Coulter reveals how liberals have been horribly wrong in all their political analyses and policy prescriptions. McCarthy, exonerated by the Venona Papers if not before, was basically right about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. Hiss turned out to be a high-ranking Soviet spy (who consulted Roosevelt at Yalta). Reagan, ridiculed throughout his presidency, ended up winning the Cold War. And George W. Bush, also an object of ridicule, has performed exceptionally in responding to America&#x2019;s newest threats at home and abroad.<br><br>Coulter, who in<b> Slander</b> exposed a liberal bias in today&#x2019;s media, also examines how history, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century, has been written by liberals and, therefore, distorted by their perspective. Far from being irrelevant today, her clearheaded and piercing view of what we&#x2019;ve been through informs us perfectly for challenges today and in the future. <br><br>With <b>Slander</b>, Ann Coulter became the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual of the year. <b>Treason</b>, in many ways an even more controversial and prescient book, will ignite impassioned political debate at one of the most crucial moments in our history.</p><p>Ann Coulter&#x2019;s books <i>Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right</i> and <i>High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton</i> were New York Times bestsellers.

You could be talking about Scrabble and they would instantly leap to the anti-American position. Everyone says liberals love America, too. No they don't. Whenever the nation is under attack, from within or without, liberals side with the enemy. This is their essence. The left's obsession with the crimes of the West and their Rousseauian respect for Third World savages all flow from this subversive goal. If anyone has the gaucherie to point out the left's nearly unblemished record of rooting against America, liberals turn around and scream "McCarthyism!"<br><br>Liberals invented the myth of McCarthyism to delegitimize impertinent questions about their own patriotism. They boast (lyingly) about their superior stance on civil rights. But somehow their loyalty to the United States is off-limits as a subject of political debate. Why is the relative patriotism of the two parties the only issue that is out of bounds for discussion? Why can't we ask: Who is more patriotic -- Democrats or Republicans? You could win that case in court.<br><br>Fifty years ago, Senator Joe McCarthy said, "The loyal Democrats of this nation no longer have a Party."(1) Since then, the evidence has continued to pour in. Liberals mock Americans who love their country, calling them cowboys, warmongers, religious zealots, and jingoists. By contrast, America's enemies are called "Uncle Joe," "Fidel," "agrarian reformers," and practitioners of a "religion of peace." Indeed, Communists and terrorists alike are said to be advocates of "peace."<br><br>Liberals demand that the nation treat enemies like friends and friends like enemies. We must lift sanctions, cancel embargoes, pull out our troops, reason with our adversaries, and absolutely never wage war -- unless the French say it's okay. Any evidence that anyone seeks to harm America is stridently rejected as "no evidence." Democratic senators, congressmen, and ex-presidents are always popping up in countries hostile to the United States -- Cuba, Nicaragua, North Korea, Iraq -- hobnobbing with foreign despots who hate America. One year after Osama bin Laden staged a massive assault on America, a Democratic senator was praising bin Laden for his good work in building "day care centers." At least we can be thankful that in the war on terrorism, we were spared the spectacle of liberals calling Osama bin Laden an "agrarian reformer."<br><br>The ACLU responded to the 9-11 terrorist attack by threatening to sue schools that hung god bless america signs. Is the ACLU more or less patriotic than the Daughters of the American Revolution? Public schools across the nation prohibited the saying of the Pledge of Allegiance. Is it more patriotic or less patriotic to prevent schoolchildren from saying the Pledge of Allegiance? University professors called patriotic Americans "naive" and described patriotism as a "benign umbrella for angry people."(2) Is it more patriotic to love your country or to ridicule those who do as "naive" and "angry"? These are not questions impenetrable to human logic.<br><br>Liberals want to be able to attack America without anyone making an issue of it. Patriotism is vitally important -- but somehow impossible to measure. Liberals relentlessly oppose the military, the Pledge of Allegiance, the flag, and national defense. But if anyone calls them on it, they say he's a kook and a nut. Citing the unpatriotic positions of liberals constitutes "McCarthyism."<br><br>In the 1988 presidential campaign, Vice President George Bush pointed out that his opponent Michael Dukakis had vetoed a bill requiring students to begin their day with the Pledge of Allegiance. Liberal heads spun with the dark reminders of the McCarthy era. Dukakis instantly compared Bush's dastardly trick of citing his record "to Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Red-baiting during the 1950s."(3) Despite this slur against his patriotism, Dukakis said, "The American people can smell the garbage."(4) At least <i>sophisticated Americans</i> could smell the garbage. As one journalist said of Bush's unwarranted reference to Dukakis's record, it was intended to "rile up" ignoramuses in the American populace: the "folks who don't know any better," whose inferior "education or experience has not taught them that the right to speak out is the rudder of this great big boat we call America."(5) The only people whose "right to speak out" is not part of this great big boat we call America are Republicans who dare to mention that a Democrat vetoed the Pledge of Allegiance. Free speech is a one-way ratchet for traitors. While journalists assailed Bush for creating an atmosphere of intolerance for those who "object to patriotic oaths," they didn't mind creating an atmosphere of intolerance toward those who support patriotic oaths.(6)<br><br>Later, while campaigning at a naval base, Bush said of Dukakis, "I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise is something you find in the Jane Fonda Workout Book."(7) Again, there were wails of "McCarthyism" all around. Showing the left's renowned ability to get a joke, one reporter earnestly demanded to know: "Did Bush mean to imply that Dukakis is anti-military?"(8) Bush responded to the hysteria over his Jane Fonda joke, saying, "Was that funny? Reasonably funny? A naval exercise -- I thought that was pretty funny."(9)<br><br>Historians claimed they had not seen "patriotism used with such cynical force" since the fifties. It was "disturbing," historians and political analysts said, for Bush to manipulate symbols to "raise doubts about the Democratic nominee's patriotism."(10) Historian William Leuchtenburger, at the University of North Carolina, said, "I don't recall anything like this before. I don't think there has been an issue like this -- an issue so irrelevant to the powers of the presidency."(11) <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Mary McGrory complained about the "McCarthyesque form" to Bush's language: "The subliminal message in all the nastiness and bad taste is that Dukakis is somehow un-American: doesn't salute the flag or dig defense."(12) <i>The New York Times</i> denounced Bush for "wrapping himself in the flag." Through his "masterly use of the subliminal" Bush had used "political code." The code was "pledge plus flag plus strong defense equals patriotism."(13) (Evidently true patriotism consists of hatred of flag plus hatred of Pledge plus weakness on national defense.) Not going for subtlety, this was under the headline "Playing Rough; Campaign Takes a Turn onto the Low Road."<br><br>A frenzy of "McCarthyism" arose again in Bush's next presidential campaign against noted patriot Bill Clinton. While a Rhodes scholar, Clinton joined anti-war protests abroad. One year after the USSR crushed Czechoslovakia, Clinton had taken what the media called a "sightseeing trip to Moscow." For mentioning Clinton's anti-war protests abroad, Bush was called a nut and a McCarthyite. Clinton campaign aide George Stephanopoulos said Bush was "off the wall, lost his compass."(14) Clinton's running mate, Al Gore, accused Bush of "smear tactics, McCarthyite techniques."(15) Meanwhile, CNN's Robert Novak defended McCarthy, saying, "Joe didn't do any innuendo, Joe would have said the guy is a Communist."(16)<br><br>"McCarthyism" means pointing out positions taken by liberals that are unpopular with the American people. As former president Bush said, "Liberals do not like me talking about liberals."(17) The reason they sob about the dark night of fascism under McCarthy is to prevent Americans from ever noticing that liberals consistently attack their own country.<br><br>Liberals unreservedly call all conservatives fascists, racists, and enemies of civil liberties with no facts whatsoever. Reviewing the movie <i>8 Mile</i> in <i>The New Yorker</i>, David Denby praised the interracial friendships portrayed in the movie and then said, "Perhaps the specter of such friendships is what right-wingers actually hate most." Conservatives are prohibited from citing actual facts that reflect poorly on a Democrat's patriotism, but liberals regularly fire off shots like that from their little movie reviews.(18)<br><br>Liberals malign the flag, ban the Pledge, and hold cocktail parties for America's enemies, but no one is ever allowed to cast the slightest aspersion on their patriotism. The very same article that attacked Bush for questioning Dukakis's patriotism questioned Bush's sensitivity to civil rights -- for mentioning Dukakis's veto of the Pledge. The writer scoffed: "George Bush will really be a stand-up guy when it comes to civil liberties. You betcha."(19) We could draw no conclusions from Dukakis's veto of the Pledge. It was a "smear" merely to state the implacable fact that Dukakis had vetoed the Pledge of Allegiance. But apparently it was not a smear to attack Bush's stand on "civil liberties for mentioning Dukakis's veto of the pledge."(20)<br><br>Only questions about patriotism are disallowed -- unless it is to say that liberals are the "real patriots." Phil Donahue said the "real patriots" were people who aggressively opposed their own country's war plans: "Are the protesters the real patriots?"(21) It is at least counterintuitive to say that it is more patriotic to attack America than to defend it. Even Donahue couldn't continue with such absurd logic, and quickly condemned patriotism as "the last refuge of scoundrels," and warned: "Beware of patriotism."(22)<br><br>In addition to opposing any action taken by your own country, "real patriotism" also consists of promoting the liberal agenda.

Jackson never sought fame, but he could not escape its light when opportunity came.</em></p> <p>Jackson was very much a man of his time, and he was not alone in this quest for personal development, but he was an earnest man with an iron resolve. Such personal discipline served him particularly well during the war that divided North and South. Although he was fatally wounded by friend fire on May 2, 1863, Jackson has continued to live in the national memory and to fascinate Americans with his remarkable achievements against incredible odds. His sobriquet "Stonewall" remains the most famous nickname in American military history. <br> <br> The manner in which Jackson lived his life was heavily influenced by the popular writings of Lord Chesterfield, whose published letters to his son on self-improvement were well known in polite society. No single work - save the Bible - more influenced Jackson in his personal evolution. While he was a cadet at West Point, he began collecting maxims as part of his quest for status as a gentleman. In the mid-1850s he carefully inscribed these maxims in a personal notebook, which disappeared after his death in 1863. Subsequent generations assumed that this notebook was a casualty of time, but in the 1990s, during his research for a biography of Jackson, James I. Robertson Jr. discovered the long-lost book of maxims in the archives of Tulane University. <br> <br> Jackson's maxims are reproduced here as he wrote them. Accompanying each are insights into the man. <strong><em>Stonewall Jackson's Book of Maxims</em> </strong>includes:</p> <ul> <li>The origin of the adage</li> <li>One or more quotations that parallel the maxim</li> <li>How Jackson may have applied the idea in his own life</li> <li>How certain maxims offer insights into the mind of the man</li> </ul> <p>These timeless insights offer as much to individuals today as they did when Jackson strove to integrate them into his life.</p></p><p>JAMES I. ROBERTSON JR. is Alumni Distinguished Professor in History at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He is an award-winning author of the biographies of Stonewall Jackson and A. P. Hill and numerous books on the Civil War. His great-grandfather was a Confederate soldier and a cook for Robert E. Lee.

Heinlein &#34;A superlatively fine novel...no writer has ever come up with a more appealing, intriguing, and workable concept of aliens.&#34; - Columbus Dispatch &#34;A spellbinder, a swashbuckler...And, best of all, it has a brilliant new approach to that fascinating problem -- first contact with aliens.&#34; - Frank Herbert &#34;One of the most engrossing tales I&#39;ve read in year...fascinating.&#34; - Theodore Sturgeon &#34;Intriguing and suspenseful...the scenes in which the humans and aliens examine one another are unforgettable.&#34; - Minneapolis Tribune &#34;Nobody does it better than Niven and Pournelle&#34; - Tom Clancy &#34;The team of Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven is one of the best in science fiction.&#34; - The Washington Times &#34;Few writers have a better pedigree&#34; - Los Angeles Times</p><p>In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched.<p> In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they've been unable to solve in over a million years.</p><p> This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle's interest in the military and sociology with Niven's talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties' biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity's economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>Writing separately, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are responsible for a number of science fiction classics, such as the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Ringworld, Debt of Honor,</i>and <i>The Integral Trees.</i> Together they have written the critically acclaimed bestsellers <i>Inferno, Footfall,</i> and <i>The Legacy of Heorot,</i>among others. <i>The Mote In God's Eye </i>is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel of mankind's first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre.</p><h2>The Unknown Catacomb: A Unique Discovery of Early Christian Art</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;During the course of excavation work on the foundations of a new building in 1955, a unique discovery of early Christian art was made in the heart of Rome. Below the city&#39;s bustling Via Latina was found to be a catacomb system containing a unique and previously unknown collection of paintings and decoration. This book tells the story of the discovery of the Via Latina catacomb and of the research and preservation work carried out to conserve it and its invaluable contents. Even more importantly, the book describes in full - in words and over 150 colour pictures - the paintings and decoration in the catacomb, with information on the themes that they illustrate from both the Old and New Testaments, including Daniel in the Lion&#39;s den and Christ among the apostles, as well as from pagan mythology, as in Hercules stealing the golden apples of the Hesperides. The author, Antonio Ferrua, not only took part in the excavation of the Via Latina catacomb, but as an archaeologist and art historian has brought to bear his wide expertise in his account of this unique fourth-century art gallery. To protect the catacomb and its treasures from twentieth-century pollution, general entry to it is restricted, making this fascinating book not only the definitive work on the catacomb but also the best access to it and its invaluable contents.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Black Water</h2><p>Flattered by the attentions of a senator she has met at a Fourth of July beach party on Grayling Island, Kelly Kelleher accepts a ride from him, taking a first step toward her final confrontation with death. 50,000 first printing.

I did not choose. I was chosen to be a dancer, and with that, you live all your life.'' This is Martha Graham, all right: intense, imperious, passionate, and at times surprisingly funny. She died early this year, still choreographing, still bitterly protesting old age, still fretting over her company's financial and artistic future. This, her own account of her life and work, is her vivid last word. Graham was born in 1894 (``Grover Cleveland was in his second presidential term...Victoria was still Queen''), in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. She reveals herself as a solitary, dramatic child in an unusual family: ``My childhood years were a balance of light and dark...the coal industry was dominant and everything we wore was eventually covered in soot.'' She takes us through her development as a dancer and choreographer, and is open and focused about the motivation and meaning of her work: ``There are always ancestral footsteps behind me, pushing me...gestures are flowing through me.'' On the strong female roles she has created: ``All the things I do are in every woman. Every woman is a Medea. Every woman is a Jocasta....'' This is not to say that men are not important to Graham: ``Men in all walks of life have sustained me. I adore men. Many have adored me.'' Many other choreographers and figures from the dance world figure here (her remarks on Lincoln Kirstein are priceless), as well as such varied personalities as Helen Keller, Madonna, and Halston. And Graham offers an honest, touching account of her brief marriage to choreographer Erick Hawkins; she tells us simply, ``There never was anyone after Erick.'' Paramount Pictures once offered a large sum to film her life story, Graham says. But she replied, ``No, absolutely not. I can ruin my own reputation in five minutes. I don't need help.'' These brief memoirs can only enhance her reputation by helping us remember the human side of a creative giant. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Both of these books come not long after Graham's death in April at the age of 96. In her memoir, the legendary Graham, the leading exponent of contemporary dance, speaks of her remarkable life. She recounts her early apprenticeship with the Denishawn School, her stint as "Art" in the Greenwich Village Follies, and the struggle to form and maintain her own company. Her poetic musings on life and dance, which are at times almost as abstract and powerful as her dance images, were written shortly before her death. She speaks with affection and candor of her friends, lovers, and coworkers, including composers Louis Horst and Aaron Copeland, designers Isamu Noguchi and Halston, and fellow dancers Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rudolf Nureyev, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, as well as many other famous names who have studied "movement" with her. Illustrated with 100 photographs, this memoir is essential to most dance collections. DeMille, Graham's lifelong friend, held off publication of her book until Graham's demise. DeMille's strong writing, combined with her personal knowledge of Graham and all the important players in Graham's life--accompanist/lover Louis Horst, husband Erick Hawkins, competitor Doris Humphrey, etc.--provide insights into the 20th-century American dance world and Graham's life that only a fellow dancer, choreographer, and woman could. Though admiring Graham's accomplishments and recognizing her genius, DeMille is not adulatory. While Graham skims lightly over the surface of her life in Blood Memory , DeMille digs deeply into events and personalities. Dance collections and most large public libraries will want both books. Graham's book was previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 6/15/91.<br><i>- Marcia L.

Enlisting in the RAF weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Geoffrey Wellum found himself fighting the Germans over the English Channel, a Spitfire pilot at just 18 years of age. This memoir follows Geoffrey through early (disastrous) training sessions, his first solo flights, his first battle and a harrowing account of being lost at sea. He describes the unique, exhilarating experience of flying a Spitfire and, also, the terrible toll that it takes on the young mind and body. At the age of 21 he is worn out physically and mentally. His war is at an end.</p><p>"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."<br> &#x2013;Winston Churchill, 1940 <p>Geoffrey Wellum was one of Churchill&#x2019;s "few," the gallant pilots of the RAF who streaked through the skies to repel the massive, brutal Nazi bombing assaults that killed thousands and leveled entire cities throughout the endless months of the Battle of Britain. To a man, they were courageous, determined, and oh, so young. Geoffrey, known as Boy to his comrades, was a good deal younger than most.</p> <p>In First Light, Geoffrey Wellum tells the inspiring, often terrifying true story of his coming of age amid the roaring, tumbling dogfights of the fiercest air war the world had ever seen. It is the story of an idealistic schoolboy who couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck when the RAF agreed to take him on as a "pupil pilot" at the minimum age of seventeen and a half in 1939. In his fervor to fly, he gave little thought to the coming war.</p> <p>Writing with wit, compassion, and a great deal of technical expertise, Wellum relives his grueling months of flight training, during which two of his classmates crashed and died. He describes a hilarious scene during his first day in the prestigious 92nd Squadron when his commander discovered that Wellum had not only never flown a Spitfire, he&#x2019;d never even seen one.</p> <p>Boy soon learned the golden rule of the dogfight: "Never fly straight and level for more than twenty seconds. If you do, you&#x2019;ll die." Wellum&#x2019;s vivid accounts of ferocious aerial combat contrast the mortal terror of an innocent teenager with the grim determination of a highly trained warrior intent on doing his job&#x2013;blasting the enemy one moment, desperately trying to shake off a pursuer the next. Few writers have succeeded more completely in evoking the chaos and horror of war.</p> <p>A battle-hardened ace by the winter of 1941, though still not out of his teens, Boy flew scores of missions as fighter escort on bombing missions over France. Yet the constant life-or-death stress of murderous combat and anguish over the loss of his closest friends sapped endurance. Tortured by fierce headaches, even in the midst of battle, he could not bear the thought of "not pulling your weight," of letting other pilots risk their lives in his place. Wellum&#x2019;s frank account of his long, losing bout with battle fatigue is both moving and enlightening.</p> <p>Filled with affectionate portraits of Boy&#x2019;s fellow fliers&#x2013;many of whom did not survive the war&#x2013;First Light tells an unforgettable true story of patriotism and fear, pride and humility, self-sacrifice and triumph. Already a bestseller in England, this powerful and compelling memoir is destined to become a classic, not only of military history, but also of literature.</p>"Wellum's First Light deserves to be read for many years to come."<br> -The Times (of London) <p>High praise for England's bestselling First Light . . . </p><p>"An extraordinarily gripping and powerful story."<br> -The Evening Standard (London) </p><p>"A work of exceptional quality . . . a passion and immediacy which make it compelling reading."<br> -Max Hastings, author of Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy </p><p>"A remarkable book, amazingly fresh, honest, and modest . . . utterly gripping; it is without question one of the best books I have read in the last few years."<br> -Professor Richard Holmes, author of Redcoat: The British Soldier in the Age of Horse and Musket </p><p>"Startlingly vivid recollections . . .this is air war at its most intense . . . his readers get a strong sense of immediacy."<br> -The Spectator (London) </p><p>"Geoffrey Wellum's book is a wonderfully evocative find . . . a book for all ages and generations, a treasure."<br> -Daily Express (London)</p></p><h2>The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition</h2><p><b>A new edition of the classic fable-which has sold more than 300,000 copies-for anyone who has suffered a permanent loss</b><br><br>Originally published in the fall of 1982, the wonderfully wise and strikingly simple story of a leaf named Freddie has become one of the most popular books of our times.

It is universally recognized as the greatest masterpiece of Japanese prose narrative, perhaps the earliest true novel in the history of the world. Until now there has been no translation that is both complete and scrupulously faithful to the original text. Edward G. Seidensticker&#39;s masterly rendering was first published in two volumes in 1976 and immediately hailed as a classic of the translator&#39;s art. It is here presented in one unabridged volume, illustrated throughout by woodcuts taken from a 1650 Japanese edition of The Tale of Genji.The Tale of Genji is a very long romance, running to fifty-four chapters and describing the court life of Heian Japan, from the tenth century into the eleventh.</p><h2>Me Talk Pretty One Day</h2><p>Anyone that has read NAKED and BARREL FEVER, or heard David Sedaris speaking live or on the radio will tell you that a new collection from him is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris from New York inspired these hilarious new pieces, including &#39;Me Talk Pretty One Day&#39;, about his attempts to learn French from a sadistic teacher who declares that &#39;every day spent with you is like having a caesarean section&#39;. His family is another inspiration. &#39;You Can&#39;t Kill the Rooster&#39; is a portrait of his brother, who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers of food and cashiers with six-inch fingernails.</p><p>"It's a pretty grim world when I can't even feel superior to a toddler." Welcome to the curious mind of David Sedaris, where dogs outrank children, guitars have breasts, and French toddlers unmask the inadequacies of the American male. Sedaris inhabits this world as a misanthrope chronicling all things petty and small. In <i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i> Sedaris is as determined as ever to be nobody's hero--he never triumphs, he never conquers--and somehow, with each failure, he inadvertently becomes everybody's favorite underdog. The world's most eloquent malcontent, Sedaris has turned self-deprecation into a celebrated art form--one that is perhaps best experienced in audio. "Go Carolina," his account of "the first battle of my war against the letter <i>s</i>" is particularly poignant. Unable to disguise the lisp that has become his trademark, Sedaris highlights (to hilarious extent) the frustration of reading "childish <i>s</i>-laden texts recounting the adventures of seals or settlers named Sassy or Samuel." Including 23 of the book version's 28 stories, two live performances complete with involuntary laughter, and an uncannily accurate Billie Holiday impersonation, the audio is more than a companion to the text; it stands alone as a performance piece--only without the sock monkeys. (Running time: 5 hours, 4 cassettes) <i>--Daphne Durham</i>With sardonic wit and incisive social critiques, David Sedaris has become one of America&#39;s pre-eminent humor writers. The great skill with which he slices through cultural euphemisms and political correctness proves that Sedaris is a master of satire and one of the most observant writers addressing the human condition today. David Sedaris is the author of Barrel Fever and Holidays on Ice, as well as collections of personal essays, Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, When You Are Engulfed in Flames and his most recent book, Let&#39;s Explore Diabetes with Owls, each of which became an immediate bestseller. The audio version of Let&#39;s Explore Diabetes With Owls was a Grammy nominee for Best Spoken Word Album. He is the author of the New York Times-bestselling collection of fables entitled Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Wicked Bestiary (with illustrations by Ian Falconer). He was also the editor of Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules: An Anthology of Outstanding Stories. Sedaris&#39;s pieces appear regularly in the New Yorker and have twice been included in &#39;The Best American Essays&#39;. There are a total of ten million copies of his books in print and they have been translated into twenty-nine languages.</p><h2>A World of Ideas : Conversations With Thoughtful Men and Women About American Life Today and the Ideas Shaping Our Future</h2><p>Conversations with thoughtful men and women about American life today and the ideas shaping our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Moyers brings us one-on-one interviews with forty-two extraordinary men and women--poets and physicists, historians and novelists, doctors and philosophers--discussing what's happening in our lives, our hearts, and our minds as we approach a new millenium.</p><p>"The true conversation of democracy," says Moyers, "occurs not between politicians or pundits but across the entire spectrum of American life." This book is a compilation of the 41 interviews that Moyers conducted for his 1988 PBS TV series, an eclectic mix of authors, scientists, educators, and philosophers, including the late Barbara Tuchman on the lessons of history; Tom Wolfe on political activism on the local scale; and former New York Public Library Director Vartan Gregorian on how libraries remind one about "one's past, present, and most of the possibilities for the future." In an age of 30-second sound bites, these thoughtful discussions are welcome and important. Recommended. See also William F.

Moyers' edited transcripts of his PBS series provide the opportunity to do just that. Moyers' background as a political journalist is especially evident in his questions about moral and governmental leadership and the future of America, but, as he notes in his introduction, he is most concerned with gaining a broader perspective on issues and choices he must make as a family member and citizen. Teachers can use parts of each interview to spark class discussions, as topics for writing assignments, and to give insight into the characters of important contemporary thinkers.<br><i>- Alice Conlon, University of Houston</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 20 (20)</h2><p>To build a new age, must one truly be mad enough to turn from the extreme justice that political allegiance requires?

Reprint.</p><p>Peter Tremayne is the pseudonym for Peter Berresford Ellis, a well-respected authority on the ancient Celts. He is the author of over twenty books, including <b>The Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, The Celtic Dawn: A History of Pan Celticism</b>, and <b>The Druids</b>. <b>Valley of the Shadow</b> is the sixth Sister Fidelma mystery. Tremayne lives in London, England.A second chapter in the seventh-century exploits of intelligent, highly educated Sister Fidelma of the Celtic Church in Ireland, aided as before by Brother Eadulf of Canterbury (Absolution by Murder, 1996). The two have traveled to Rome, where Fidelma is to deliver messages to His Holiness and where Eadulf will serve as scribe to archbishop-designate Wighard of Canterbury, the guest of Bishop Gelasius at Lateran Palace. Among the many pilgrims in the city to witness Wighard's ordination are Abbott Puttoc of Saxony, an ambitious libertine, and haughty Abbess Wulfrun and her companion-servant Sister Eafa of Kent. Before the ceremony can take place, though, Wighard is found strangled in his quarters, and Irish monk Ronan Ragallach is accused of the killing but escapes his captors. Not completely convinced of Ronan's guilt, and aware of Fidelma and Eadulf's previous successes, Bishop Gelasius asks their help and assigns soldier Licinius to ease their way. As Fidelma goes about the tedious questioning of everyone in the vicinity at the crucial time, the body count begins to mount and various intricate plots are uncovered. In the end, though, Fidelma finds the answer to their quest rooted in the heinous crimes of the not-so-distant past. The author's passion for the period results in an unrelenting stream of information--on Church theology, hierarchy, politics, rituals and residences, to say nothing of chapels and catacombs. The diffuse plotting, rarely compelling, suffocates under the onslaught. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The issues it tackled, from the failures of the drug war and criminal justice system to systemic bias in law enforcement and other social institutions, have become more urgent and central to the national conversation. The show's actors, such as Idris Elba, Dominic West, and Michael B. Jordan, have gone on to become major stars. Its creators and writers, including David Simon and Richard Price, have developed dedicated cult followings of their own. Universities use the show to teach everything from film theory to criminal justice to sociology. Politicians and activists reference it when discussing policy.

It is arguably one of the great works of art America has produced in the 20th century.<br><br>But while there has been a great deal of critical analysis of the show and its themes, until now there has never been a definitive, behind-the-scenes take on how it came to be made.

The moment would mark the beginning of a collaboration neither could have foreseen, one that would mature into a groundbreaking book and culminate in a revolutionary television show. But first impressions? Burns joked&#x2014;well, partly anyway&#x2014;that he hoped to arrest Simon. Somehow, Simon had finagled his way beyond security and into the Drug Enforcement Administration offices as Burns readied material for a grand jury preparing to bring an indictment against Melvin &#x201c;Little&#x201d; Williams, a disciplined drug trafficker who had successfully flummoxed Baltimore law enforcement for years. Simon told Burns that he was a reporter for The Baltimore Sun and had permission to follow the case. Burns and his partner, Harry Edgerton, both Baltimore police detectives, had finally pinned the elusive Williams through the use of a wiretap. Simon expressed interest in being able to listen in on the wire. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to take you in there, but if I do, that&#x2019;s a ten-year offense and I&#x2019;d love to lock you up,&#x201d; Burns said. He stiff-armed Simon&#x2019;s request, but agreed to meet with him later to discuss the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Who the fuck is this guy? </i>David Simon thought after meeting Burns a second time. Not much time had passed when they greeted one another at the Baltimore County Public Library branch in Towson. Simon had already surmised that Burns did not behave like any typical detective he had come across. He now eyeballed the book titles Burns prepared to check out, Bob Woodward&#x2019;s <i>Veil: Secret Wars of the CIA</i> and <i>The Magus</i>, by John Fowles, among them. &#x201c;I read all the time, and it impressed him,&#x201d; Burns recalled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think David reads anywhere near as much as I do, but a cop reads? My God. I know a lot of cops who read. It was no big deal, but David was a good guy and he had a passion.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That passion unfurled into the canvassing five-part series that Simon wrote on the making and inner workings of Williams as a Baltimore drug trafficker kingpin. For Simon, his life&#x2019;s purpose had been achieved by working at a newspaper. His father, Bernard, had once been a journalist who devoted the bulk of his working days as a public relations director for B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith, the oldest Jewish service organization in the world. His mother, Dorothy, spent time working for an organization that aided students from underachieving public schools to find better education. Simon attended the University of Maryland, where he wrote for the student newspaper, <i>The Diamondback</i>. He joined the <i>Sun</i> after graduating, reporting on crime. To him, being a newspaperman and bringing accountability to influencers meant something. &#x201c;I grew up in a house where we argued politics,&#x201d; Simon recounted. &#x201c;We argued sociology. We argued culture. We argued. It was not personal. Arguing was how you got attention in my family.&#x201d; One of Simon&#x2019;s enduring memories is debating politics with his two uncles as a boy, the moment climaxing with him flatly telling his uncle Hank that he was in the wrong. &#x201c;Who knew he had a brain?&#x201d; Uncle Hank retorted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading Simon&#x2019;s 1987 <i>Sun</i> series, entitled &#x201c; &#x2018;Easy Money&#x2019;: Anatomy of a Drug Empire,&#x201d; is akin to viewing the organs of The Wire&#x2019;s first-season wiretap investigation. Williams was a self-made entrepreneur who imported the bulk of Baltimore&#x2019;s heroin influx as the city&#x2019;s honest economic opportunities shifted and dwindled. &#x201c;An imperious, intelligent man who chooses words with care,&#x201d; Simon described &#x201c;Melvin Williams refuses to be stereotyped. Street sales of narcotics were routinely punctuated by murderous violence, but Williams was a family man, devoted to an eleven-year marriage and two young daughters.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Williams conducted most of his business through his number two, a consigliere named Lamont &#x201c;Chin&#x201d; Farmer. Farmer orchestrated both a simple and intricate communication system involving the use of beepers. He also headed a print shop and took business courses at a community college, � la Idris Elba&#x2019;s Stringer Bell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon&#x2019;s series meticulously captured Williams&#x2019;s life and downfall&#x2014;not only as a drug kingpin, but also as a respected figure in the community, where, as Simon wrote, &#x201c;he was hailed as Little Melvin, the Citizen, speaking at the request of National Guard officials during the 1968 riots, urging a restless crowd to go home.&#x201d; Burns appreciated that Simon showed all facets of the case and offered a depiction of Williams that was beyond a caricature. &#x201c;When the case came down, he wrote a very good article because he went out and saw some of the gangsters and it was a most balanced article,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;I liked that.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon spent Christmas Eve 1986 on an overnight shift with the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit for another story shortly before the series on Williams debuted. During that night, a detective mentioned that someone could write a damn good book if they documented the department&#x2019;s happenings for a year. With the permission of Police Commissioner Edward Tilghman, Simon gained complete access to be a fly on the wall with the unit, despite the objections of some of the department&#x2019;s personnel. &#x201c;A captain had a vote,&#x201d; said Jay Landsman, then a homicide detective sergeant, who also lent his name and acting abilities to The Wire. &#x201c;He took a poll of who wanted to do it and who didn&#x2019;t. Twenty-eight out of thirty of us, including myself, voted against it. We worked murders in the ghetto. You lived in a gray area with that. It doesn&#x2019;t always look pretty. Everything we did was legal, but it was kind of how were they going to interpret it? So, naturally, since they had a democratic election and we all voted against it, they gave him the go-ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon took a leave from <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>, becoming a &#x201c;police intern&#x201d; in January 1988. Members of the department playfully hazed him until he proved game for the task. He gained enough insight into the minds of the squad members that some later acknowledged that he had accurately captured words and feelings they had never verbally expressed. Houghton Mifflin published <i>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</i> in June 1991. The book, like the series on Williams, is peppered with scenes later extracted for <i>The Wire</i>. In it, Simon provides a penetrating portrait of how the detectives attempted to unravel murder cases and the humanistic toll it took on them. &#x201c;It was daily that we told him if he printed anything we didn&#x2019;t like, we would kill him,&#x201d; Landsman said. &#x201c;But he grinned at everything. As it turns out, we weren&#x2019;t as bad as we thought we would be portrayed by David.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ed Burns, working another prolonged investigation, scarcely figured into the book. He was already grappling with the limits of how little one outside-the-box thinker could influence a lurching institution. &#x201c;We were like family,&#x201d; Landsman said. &#x201c;But [Burns] was the biggest pain in the ass in the world. He once said everybody in police should have a bachelor&#x2019;s or master&#x2019;s degree. I said, &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;d all be like you. That would be hell, because you&#x2019;re an asshole.&#x2019; It was all in fun, but he played to his own drummer. When you really needed something done, you had to just put your foot down on it. But he was tenacious as hell, a little bit gullible. Like that informant Bubbles that he had. I wouldn&#x2019;t believe Bubbles as far as I could throw him. A broken clock is right at least twice a day, and I guess that&#x2019;s the two times he gave Burns good information.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Burns left the police force, having knocked his head against his superiors for much of his two decades as a patrolman, plainclothesman, and detective. He was about to start his new life as a middle school teacher when Simon proposed a collaboration. Simon&#x2019;s book editor, John Sterling, suggested that the proper follow-up to Homicide would be observing a drug corner in Baltimore for a year and depicting the story&#x2019;s previously undocumented other side of addicts. Burns agreed to contribute, and the two settled on the intersection of West Baltimore&#x2019;s Fayette and Monroe. For weeks, Burns spent his days gaining the confidence of dealers and users, while Simon worked at the newspaper before taking a second leave. &#x201c;The badge can get you under that yellow tape, but it can&#x2019;t get you into their shooting galleries and places like that,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;I could sit down on the third floor of a shooting gallery with five or six guys pumping all around me, a prostitute working out in the bed over there, and have a conversation. Every once in a while, they take the syringe off [from behind] their ear, get a little hit, put it back on, and it would be a conversation where you knew that these people were aware of what was going on and how they had been sucked into this trap.&#x201d; As he had in Homicide, Simon displayed a perceptive ear in deciphering the corner&#x2019;s dialogue. He had to learn the appropriate jokes to laugh at, when to show concern, when to blend in, or when to pop up with a question. Homicide was heavily saturated with cop jargon&#x2014;a red ball, a whodunit, dunkers. <i>The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood </i>was published in 1997 and introduced the reader to a new vocabulary, with words such as testers, the snake, and speedballs. The piercing narrative focused on the McCullough family and their efforts to function as a unit even as they dealt with the toll drugs extracted from them. Gary McCullough, the father, had been a businessman who fell into the throes of addiction once his marriage to Fran Boyd crumbled. Boyd, also addicted to drugs at the time, still tried mapping a better life for her sons. They included DeAndre McCullough, who, at the age of fifteen, had already begun peddling drugs. (DeAndre would go on to work on the set of The Wire and portray Lamar, Brother Mouzone&#x2019;s dim associate, before his death at the age of thirty-five in 2012.) Some, including a few inside The Baltimore Sun, accused Simon of ennobling and romanticizing drug dealers and users. In truth, the book offered a voice to those who had been left behind as forgotten casualties of the war on drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon originally did not think much of the deal when the Baltimore-born director Barry Levinson bought the rights to <i>Homicide</i> and plotted to develop it into a TV show for NBC. Simon passed on an offer to write the show&#x2019;s pilot&#x2014;he just hoped that a television show would help sell a few more copies of the book. He accepted a subsequent offer from showrunner Tom Fontana to write another episode and teamed with his college friend David Mills to author an episode that would premiere the show&#x2019;s second season in 1994. The episode, titled &#x201c;Bop Gun,&#x201d; guest-starred Robin Williams and won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay of an Episodic Drama. The experience left Simon unsated. Only half of what he and Mills had written, Simon estimated, prevailed in the final script. While Mills departed for Hollywood soon after, Simon returned to the newspaper, satisfied to spend the rest of his working days arguing with his feet up and bumming cigarettes off younger reporters. But the paper, his paper, started feeling more unfamiliar. It had been purchased in 1986 by the Times Mirror Company. Buyouts cut into the depth and experience of the newsroom. Simon felt that the new top editors placed an unwarranted emphasis on claiming journalism prizes rather than covering the mundane issues plaguing Baltimore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon accepted a buyout, jumping full time to the staff of <i>Homicide</i>. Under Fontana and producer/writer James Yoshimura, he learned how to transfer his journalistic skills into writing for television. It was Fontana who mentored Simon, telling him that a writer becomes a producer in order to protect his words. Some of the cast and crew dreaded whenever Simon arrived on set. They knew they would be pelted with questions, and they tried avoiding eye contact with him. &#x201c;It was questions with wardrobe,&#x201d; said Jeffrey Pratt Gordon, who worked in the art department of Homicide before acting as Johnny &#x201c;Fifty&#x201d; Spamanto in The Wire&#x2019;s Season 2. &#x201c;It was questions with the cinematographer. He was asking everybody questions, and a lot of the times that he asked the questions is right when we&#x2019;re sort of in the middle of doing stuff. What&#x2019;s this guy poking around for? What&#x2019;s this guy always asking questions about?&#x201d; It was only years later that he surmised Simon had been educating himself in every aspect of filmmaking. Still, television did not entirely appeal to Simon. He had left the newspaper but remained an arguer, one ready to rail against the status quo. The Washington Post tried hiring him, and he mulled over the offer. It was not until Fontana showed him something else that he had been working on, a pilot for a prison drama shot for HBO named Oz, that Simon visualized television as a worthwhile megaphone. Oz painted a grim world where the initial concerns would not consist of who won and who lost or cleanly separate the bad guys from the good guys. Simon contemplated whether something like The Corner could be adapted for television. Through Fontana, he gained an audience with HBO. He pitched them on what would have been <i>The Wire</i>, telling Burns, &#x201c;If HBO&#x2019;s interested in this world, we could write a fictional show.&#x201d; The HBO executives Chris Albrecht, Anne Thomopoulos, and Kary Antholis looked at one another. &#x201c;Just do the book,&#x201d; Antholis said. &#x201c;Just do the characters in the book. You have six hours. It&#x2019;s a miniseries.&#x201d; HBO, Simon thought, would need a black writer associated with the project. He floated the possibility of attaching David Mills. The name appealed to the executives but left no place for Burns. Instead, Simon asked Burns to begin outlining the fictionalized world. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t like what happened because David was not forthcoming,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;He believed he needed a black writer on the show. They wanted me to do another script as if there was going to be seven episodes instead of the six, which was totally not going to happen. They took me out to a restaurant and they fumbled through this, &#x2018;We were thinking about this and that,&#x2019; and I&#x2019;m thinking to myself, You guys, there would be no Corner, because David wasn&#x2019;t going to go out there by himself. I was more than happy to go out because I liked the experience. I liked to do things like that. David waited until it was safe to go out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decision to commit to <i>The Corner,</i> recalled Chris Albrecht, HBO&#x2019;s chairman and CEO, came down to a choice between Simon&#x2019;s project or an adaptation of Taylor Branch&#x2019;s work on the civil rights movement. He took scripts from both on a cross-country plane ride. Albrecht opened The Corner first. Oh man, that&#x2019;s so depressing, he thought. No one is going to want to watch this. He picked up Branch&#x2019;s scripts. He found them entertaining, but his mind wandered back to The Corner, wondering what would happen next. He picked it up again and sifted through the next few pages. This is too intense, he thought. It&#x2019;s just so intense and so raw. The same scenario played out a few more times. As worthwhile as the Taylor Branch project was, anybody could do that, he finally decided. Only HBO could do<i> The Corner</i>.</p></p><h2>Zen &amp; The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenanc</h2><p>Acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of american letters, this modern epic became an instant bestseller upon publication in 1974, transforming a generation and continuing to inspire millions a narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, the book becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions of how to live resonant with the confusions of existence, zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is a touching and transcendent book of life</p><p>In his now classic <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.<p> Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. </p><p> In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar�, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between <i>The Razor's Edge</i> and <i>Sophie's World</i>, <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> takes us into "the high country of the mind" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>The extraordinary story of a man's quest for truth.

Working on a motorcycle, working well, caring, is to become part of a process, to achieve an inner peace of mind. The motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon." -- Robert M. Pirsig</p><p> "Profoundly important... full of insights into our most perplexing contemporary dilemmas... It is intellectual entertainment of the highest order." -- <i>The New York Times</i> </p><p> "It lodges in the mind as few recent novels have... The book is inspired, original... As the mountains gentle toward the sea--with father and child locked in a ghostly grip--the narrative tact, the perfect economy of effect defy criticism... The analogies with <i>Moby Dick</i> are patent. Robert Pirsig invites the prodigious comparison... What more can one say?" -- <i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p> "It's a miracle.. sparkles like an electric dream.

Plus it was written by Anne Rice&#39;s biographer and authorized by Anne Rice herself, so this is really an important guidebook.--E. Zack, Sr. Editor, The Ballantine Publishing Group</p><h2>Bind Us Apart: How Enlightened Americans Invented Racial Segregation</h2><p>Why did the Founding Fathers fail to include blacks and Indians in their cherished proposition that "all men are created equal"? The usual answer is racism, but the reality is more complex and unsettling. In <i>Bind Us Apart</i>, historian Nicholas Guyatt argues that, from the Revolution through the Civil War, most white liberals believed in the unity of all human beings. But their philosophy faltered when it came to the practical work of forging a color-blind society. Unable to convince others-and themselves-that racial mixing was viable, white reformers began instead to claim that people of color could only thrive in separate republics: in Native states in the American West or in the West African colony of Liberia.<br><br>Herein lie the origins of "separate but equal." Decades before Reconstruction, America's liberal elite was unable to imagine how people of color could become citizens of the United States. Throughout the nineteenth century, Native Americans were pushed farther and farther westward, while four million slaves freed after the Civil War found themselves among a white population that had spent decades imagining that they would live somewhere else.<br><br>Essential reading for anyone disturbed by America's ongoing failure to achieve true racial integration, <i>Bind Us Apart</i> shows conclusively that "separate but equal" represented far more than a southern backlash against emancipation-it was a founding principle of our nation.<br><br></p><p><b>Nicholas Guyatt</b> is a university lecturer in history at the University of Cambridge. He is a regular contributor to the <i>Nation</i>, <i>London Review of Books</i>, and <i>Guardian</i>. Guyatt lives in Cambridge, England.<br>"Read this after listening to your 'Hamilton' cast recording."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] compelling work of wide research.... A nuanced study of the illusory, troubling early arguments over emancipation and integration." &#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A timely and instructive look at how deeply racism is embedded in America's past."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Nicholas Guyatt offers an elegant and illuminating analysis of the winding and tortured path to the separate and unequal society we recognize even today. This is a must read for all who are interested in the origins of America's troubled racial landscape."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Annette Gordon-Reed, professor of law and professor of history at Harvard University</b></i></b><br><br>"Nicholas Guyatt is a master storyteller and a brilliant scholar. With <i>Bind Us Apart</i>, he has written a provocative and counter-intuitive--but never contrarian or glib--account of the origins of segregation in the United States. This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the racial fault lines that continue to divide this country today."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ari Kelman, McCabe Greer Professor of History at Penn State University and author of <i>A Misplaced Massacre: Struggling Over the Memory of Sand Creek</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Nicholas Guyatt brilliantly captures the tragically unintended consequences of liberal reformers' efforts to create a just and enlightened multiracial society in the new United States. Dedication to the principles of the Declaration of Independence ultimately led reformers to embrace both the colonization of former slaves and the removal of Native Americans. Sympathetically engaging with his well-intentioned subjects, Guyatt compels us to engage with what it has meant--and still means--to be American. Powerfully argued and beautifully written, <i>Bind Us Apart</i> is essential reading." &#x2015;<b><i><b>Peter S. Onuf, author of <i>Jefferson's Empire: The Language of American Nationhood</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Provocative.... Mr. Guyatt makes many convincing arguments in this book....

Guyatt's juxtaposition of attitudes and policies relating to Indians and blacks yields important insights."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] brilliant and provocative new book.... By demonstrating that segregationist ideas began at the founding, were sanctioned by well-intentioned white liberals, and had spread across the nation, Guyatt has written a remarkable history that matches the gravity of the problem."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New Republic</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Ambitious, intriguing... this is a useful, fascinating revisionist examination of US views and policies on race before the Civil War...

Mitsugi Saotome examines the spiritual philosophy of the Founder, the warrior ideals of feudal Japan as the basis of his martial arts philosophy, and the scientific principles underlying the philosophy of Aikido technique. <br><br>The author shows that the physical movement of Aikido is the embodiment of principles of the spirit. Negative force is not countered with aggression but is controlled and redirected through the power and balance of spiral movement. This is the shape of Aikido and the dynamic shape at the foundation of all energies of existence. Aikido movement can only be understood from its roots in universal law and the processes of nature. The sincere practice and study of Aikido deepens our appreciation for the perfection of nature's balance and brings us back into harmony with our environment, other people, and ourselves. <br><br>Abundantly illustrated with the author's drawings, diagrams, and calligraphies, as well as photographs demonstrating Aikido techniques, the book also offers a history of Aikido, personal anecdotes about the Founder, and translations of several of his lectures.</p><p>Mitsugi Saotome Sensei is the founder of the Aikido Schools of Ueshiba and the chief instructor at the Aikido Shobukan Dojo in Washington, D.C.

Desperate to get in the air, he makes it through basic training to become the youngest Spitfire pilot in the prestigious 92 Squadron. Thrust into combat almost immediately, Wellum finds himself flying several sorties a day, caught up in terrifying dogfights with German Me 109s. Over the coming months he and his fellow pilots play a crucial role in the Battle of Britain. But of the friends that take to the air alongside Wellum many never return.</p><p>"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."<br> &#x2013;Winston Churchill, 1940 <p>Geoffrey Wellum was one of Churchill&#x2019;s "few," the gallant pilots of the RAF who streaked through the skies to repel the massive, brutal Nazi bombing assaults that killed thousands and leveled entire cities throughout the endless months of the Battle of Britain. To a man, they were courageous, determined, and oh, so young. Geoffrey, known as Boy to his comrades, was a good deal younger than most.</p> <p>In First Light, Geoffrey Wellum tells the inspiring, often terrifying true story of his coming of age amid the roaring, tumbling dogfights of the fiercest air war the world had ever seen. It is the story of an idealistic schoolboy who couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck when the RAF agreed to take him on as a "pupil pilot" at the minimum age of seventeen and a half in 1939. In his fervor to fly, he gave little thought to the coming war.</p> <p>Writing with wit, compassion, and a great deal of technical expertise, Wellum relives his grueling months of flight training, during which two of his classmates crashed and died. He describes a hilarious scene during his first day in the prestigious 92nd Squadron when his commander discovered that Wellum had not only never flown a Spitfire, he&#x2019;d never even seen one.</p> <p>Boy soon learned the golden rule of the dogfight: "Never fly straight and level for more than twenty seconds. If you do, you&#x2019;ll die." Wellum&#x2019;s vivid accounts of ferocious aerial combat contrast the mortal terror of an innocent teenager with the grim determination of a highly trained warrior intent on doing his job&#x2013;blasting the enemy one moment, desperately trying to shake off a pursuer the next. Few writers have succeeded more completely in evoking the chaos and horror of war.</p> <p>A battle-hardened ace by the winter of 1941, though still not out of his teens, Boy flew scores of missions as fighter escort on bombing missions over France. Yet the constant life-or-death stress of murderous combat and anguish over the loss of his closest friends sapped endurance. Tortured by fierce headaches, even in the midst of battle, he could not bear the thought of "not pulling your weight," of letting other pilots risk their lives in his place. Wellum&#x2019;s frank account of his long, losing bout with battle fatigue is both moving and enlightening.</p> <p>Filled with affectionate portraits of Boy&#x2019;s fellow fliers&#x2013;many of whom did not survive the war&#x2013;First Light tells an unforgettable true story of patriotism and fear, pride and humility, self-sacrifice and triumph. Already a bestseller in England, this powerful and compelling memoir is destined to become a classic, not only of military history, but also of literature.</p>"Wellum's First Light deserves to be read for many years to come."<br> -The Times (of London) <p>High praise for England's bestselling First Light . . . </p><p>"An extraordinarily gripping and powerful story."<br> -The Evening Standard (London) </p><p>"A work of exceptional quality . . . a passion and immediacy which make it compelling reading."<br> -Max Hastings, author of Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy </p><p>"A remarkable book, amazingly fresh, honest, and modest . . . utterly gripping; it is without question one of the best books I have read in the last few years."<br> -Professor Richard Holmes, author of Redcoat: The British Soldier in the Age of Horse and Musket </p><p>"Startlingly vivid recollections . . .this is air war at its most intense . . . his readers get a strong sense of immediacy."<br> -The Spectator (London) </p><p>"Geoffrey Wellum's book is a wonderfully evocative find . . . a book for all ages and generations, a treasure."<br> -Daily Express (London)</p></p><h2>Paper Money: A Novel</h2><p><b>An explosive novel of high finance and underworld villainy from Ken Follett, the grand master of international action and suspense.&nbsp;<b>Look out for Ken's newest book,&nbsp;<i>A Column of Fire</i>, available now.</b></b><br><br>Crime, high finances, and journalism are interconnected in this early thriller by the author of <i>On Wings of Eagles&nbsp;</i>and <i>Lie Down With Lions</i>.

Culturally significant events such as the shift in prehistoric times from spear and atlatl to the bow, or, in the historic period, the introduction of the horse into the Southwest, are recorded in rock art.</p><p>The illustrations--thirty-two color plates, nearly 250 photographs, and numerous line drawings--bring together in one volume petroglyphs and rock paintings that are scattered over thousands of miles of desert and mesa, giving the reader an overview of Indian rock art that would be nearly impossible to achieve in the field.</p><p><i>Indian Rock Art of the Southwest</i> examines from an archaeological perspective the rich legacy of stone drawings and carvings preserved throughout the Southwest.

In writing this book, Rhodes has drawn upon his own understanding of firing processes, as well as information which he has gathered from sources throughout the world. <br><br>The first section of the book traces the development of individual kilns, stressing their firing principles and their strengths and weaknesses. Beginning with primitive firing methods, Rhodes moves on to the evolution of kilns in China, Korea, and Japan, and then discusses the history and growth of Europeans kilns. <br><br>The principles and methods involved in kiln design and construction receive a thorough and authoritative treatment. The information which applies to the structure and size of any kiln, be it gas-fired, oil-fired, wood burning, or electric, up draft or downdraft, is the basis for discussion of methods and procedures required by specific kilns. Thus, all of the aspects of kiln construction and design... masonry construction, fuels, burners, and combustion, refractory materials, heat retention, and transfer... are covered. <br><br>One section is totally devoted to kiln operation. Firing theory and techniques, temperature measurement and control, and safety precautions are among the areas covered. <br><br>Many original kiln designs, accompanied by step-by-step instructions and diagrams, enable those who wish to build a kiln to proceed with both knowledge and confidence. <br><br>The book is illustrated throughout with numerous drawings, diagrams, tables, and photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

I smell the blood of an Englishman.&#x201d;</p> <p>As the giant ogre in the Winter Parva pantomime strutted across the stage, uttering the old familiar words, Agatha Raisin stifled a yawn. She loathed amateur dramatics, but had been persuaded to support the pantomime by her friend, Mrs. Bloxby, the vicar&#x2019;s wife. The two women were in odd contrast: Agatha with her smart clothes and glossy brown hair, Mrs. Bloxby in faded tweeds and wispy brown hair streaked with grey surrounding her gentle face.</p> <p>Agatha began to feel sulky and trapped. Why was she, a private detective of some fame, wasting her sweetness on the desert air of the Winter Parva village hall?</p> <p>The pantomime was <i>Babes in the Woods,</i> but there were also characters from other pantomimes from <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> to <i>Puss in Boots.</i></p> <p>At last the interval arrived. There was no theatre bar but mulled wine was being served in the entrance hall. Agatha grabbed a glass and said, &#x201c;Going outside for a cigarette.&#x201d;</p> <p>Fog lay heavily on the car park and water dripped mournfully from the trees surrounding it. &#x201c;Still smoking? Dear me,&#x201d; said a voice behind Agatha. She swung round and found herself looking down at the gossip of her home village, Carsely, Mrs. Arnold.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Agatha curtly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you know that only twenty percent of the people in Britain now smoke?&#x201d; said Mrs. Arnold.</p> <p>&#x201c;I never believe in statistics,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;Have they asked everyone?&#x201d; She surveyed Mrs. Arnold&#x2019;s small round figure. &#x201c;Anyway, what about overeating? What about a ban on <i>fat</i> people?&#x201d;</p> <p>A tall man loomed up out of the mist. &#x201c;What do you think of the show?&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha bit back the word <i>hellish</i> that had risen to her lips and said instead, &#x201c;I think the chap playing the ogre is very good. Who is he?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our local baker, Bert Simple. I haven&#x2019;t introduced myself. I recognise you. I&#x2019;m Gareth Craven, producer of the show. That&#x2019;s the end of the interval. I&#x2019;d better get backstage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Agatha Raisin,&#x201d; Agatha called after him.</p> <p>Quite tasty, thought Agatha, watching his tall figure disappear into the fog. Well, hullo hormones, I thought you had laid down and died.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>She shuffled along her seat beside Mrs. Bloxby. The hall smelled of damp people, mulled wine, and chocolates. A surprising number had brought boxes of chocolates. Pen lights flickered, voices murmured things like, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a hard one. Are those liqueur chocolates, you naughty man!&#x201d; Children, used to slumping on comfortable sofas in front of the television, screamed and hit each other.</p> <p>The curtains were drawn back and the comedian came on. &#x201c;Hullo, hullo, hullo!&#x201d; he yelled.</p> <p>&#x201c;Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,&#x201d; muttered Agatha.</p> <p>The comedian was a local man, George Southern, who owned a gift shop in the village.</p> <p>He was slightly built and rather camp with thin brown hair and a large nose which overshadowed his small mouth.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re in good voice tonight, folks,&#x201d; he said. A screen came down behind him. It&#x2019;s the compulsory sing-along, thought Agatha bleakly.</p> <p>Sure enough. The words of &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Long Way to Tipperary&#x201d; appeared on the screen. Why an old First World War song, wondered Agatha, and then came to the conclusion that they were possibly frightened that anything more modern would incur royalties. From previous experience, she knew that amateur dramatic companies seemed to think the eyes of the world were on them. It seemed to go on forever. He got the men to sing, then the women, then the children. &#x201c;Follow the bouncing ball,&#x201d; he yelled, strutting about the stage in his moment of glory.</p> <p>The curtains were drawn again and opened to reveal a cardboard cottage. The Babes were played by two ill-favoured children, who turned out to be the son and daughter of the head of the parish council, which was why they had landed the parts.</p> <p>&#x201c;Here comes the ogre again,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there supposed to be a witch?&#x201d; said Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; admonished a voice behind them.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fee! Fie! Fo! Fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman,&#x201d; roared Bert. &#x201c;Be he alive, or be he dead, I&#x2019;ll grind his bones to make my bread.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was a burly man with a big round head and small glittering eyes, wearing built-up boots to make him look like a giant.</p> <p>Slowly descending on a creaking wire came the Good Fairy. It broke when she was nearly down and she fell on a heap on the stage. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you bloody bastards do anything properly?&#x201d; she yelled. The children whistled and cheered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Shame!&#x201d; called a voice from the audience. &#x201c;Remember the children.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Good Fairy rallied, picked up her bent wand and faced the ogre. &#x201c;I am banishing you to the pit from whence you came,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>There was an impressive puff of green smoke. A trapdoor opened and Bert disappeared. The small orchestra started to play a jolly tune. A chorus lineup of ill-assorted tap dancers thudded their way across the stage. The pantomime dragged on to the close. At the final curtain, there was no sign of Bert.</p> <p>&#x201c;It was all right, considering it was an amateur show,&#x201d; ventured Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>Agatha bit back the nasty remark that was rising to her lips. The two women had come in their separate cars. She said goodnight to her friend, warning her to drive carefully, because the fog was even thicker.</p> <p>As Agatha was nearing Carsely, police cars heading for Winter Parva raced past on the other side of the road. Agatha did a U-turn and followed them. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s up,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Maybe someone&#x2019;s murdered that dreadful comedian.&#x201d;</p> <p>Soon she could see flashing blue lights outside the village hall.</p> <p>The thick mist meant she was able to get into the car park before the police taped off the area. Where was the stage door? That chap, Gareth, had left and gone round the side of the building.</p> <p>She walked round the side of the building and found a small door, standing open. A policeman supporting Gareth Craven came along a corridor inside. &#x201c;If I could just get some fresh air,&#x201d; said Gareth. His face was chalk white.</p> <p>Agatha stepped boldly forward. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a friend of Mr. Craven,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look after him. You can come out when you&#x2019;re ready and take a statement. I have a Peugeot parked outside.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mrs. Bloxby,&#x201d; said Agatha, fearing that the sound of her own name would alert the policeman to the fact that she was a private detective.</p> <p>&#x201c;Registration number of your car?&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha gave it to him and then put an arm around Gareth&#x2019;s waist. &#x201c;Come along,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve some brandy in the car.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I thought you were Agatha Raisin,&#x201d; said Gareth.</p> <p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; said Agatha, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t want that policeman to know that. Here we are. In you go and I&#x2019;ll get the heater on.&#x201d;</p> <p>Once Gareth was settled in the passenger seat and had taken a few swigs of brandy from a flask Agatha kept in the car, Agatha said, &#x201c;What happened in there?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It was awful,&#x201d; said Gareth. &#x201c;When Bert didn&#x2019;t appear for the curtain call, I went back to look for him. He wasn&#x2019;t in any of the dressing rooms. I went down under the platform and there he was. Oh, God!&#x201d;</p> <p>He buried his face in his hands. Agatha waited until she thought he had recovered and said, &#x201c;Go on. What happened to him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He was standing there, very still, his mouth opened in a sort of awful silent scream. There was a big pool of blood at his feet. I couldn&#x2019;t find a pulse. I ran upstairs and phoned police, ambulance and fire brigade. The lot. I couldn&#x2019;t bear any more. That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p> <p>There was a peremptory rap on the car window. Agatha lowered it and found Detective Sergeant Bill Wong staring accusingly at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll speak to you later,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mr. Craven. Please come with me. We need a statement. And Mrs. Raisin, please drive your car beyond the taped-off police area.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bill must be really cross to call me Mrs. Raisin, thought Agatha. The young detective was the first friend she ever made when she came to the Cotswolds.</p> <p>She decided to drive home and wait for the news the following day. Whatever had happened to Bert, it would be too late for the morning papers, but there might be something on television. But if it were an accident, then nothing would appear at all.</p> <p>She was to get the news from an unexpected quarter.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The following day was Sunday. Agatha contemplated making one of her rare visits to morning service, thought better of it, turned over and went back to sleep.</p> <p>She did not get up until midday. She rose, dressed and went down to feed her cats, Hodge and Boswell, and let them out into the garden. An icy wind was blowing. Both cats turned on the threshold and looked up at her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; urged Agatha. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got fur coats on, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Just then, the front doorbell rang. When Agatha opened the door, it was to find a tired-looking Mrs. Bloxby on the step.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful,&#x201d; said the vicar&#x2019;s wife.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the coffee on.&#x201d;</p> <p>She waited until her friend was seated at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee, and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been out a good part of last night. Mrs. Simple was in a terrible state. She asked to speak to Alf.&#x201d; Alf was the vicar. &#x201c;We both went to Winter Parva. The doctor had been called and had given Mrs. Simple a tranquilliser but she was still in a state. She said God was punishing her for being a bad wife.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was Bert&#x2019;s death murder? Was she saying she killed him?&#x201d; asked Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, not at all. But it appears to have been a particularly vicious murder. And well thought out, too. A small square had been cut out of the elevator platform. Evidently it always descended a bit too quickly and landed with a bump. Well, when Mr. Simple descended, a long steel spike had been embedded in the floor so that it went up through the hole in the platform, right between his legs and up into his body. Alf and I managed to persuade Mrs. Simple to go to bed and we sat and talked quietly to her until she fell asleep.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t Winter Parva have a vicar?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, Alf takes services there twice a month.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait a bit,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get this. How on earth would anyone have time to fix that spike and not be discovered?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Simple was killed the first time he descended. That was towards the end of the pantomime. Evidently he had been complaining about the speed it went down and said he would only do it the once.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But there would be a dress rehearsal!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose so. His son, Walt, told us that no one goes down there except the blacksmith.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do we have blacksmiths in this day and age?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, of course. We have three hunts around here. And Mr. Crosswith, the blacksmith, also does wrought-iron gates and things. Bert had been complaining that the trap was a bit dangerous. Mr. Crosswith designed a star trap from some old Victorian drawings.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What is a star trap?&#x201d; asked Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;Star traps consist of a permanent stage floor, made up of several triangular sections of flooring meeting at the centre, which may be lifted but which naturally fall flat. Under the stage is an elevator using counterweights that are heavier than the weight of the performer.</p> <p>&#x201c;To make an impressive entrance, the elevator platform is first lowered, at which point a brake is applied, to stop the counterweight falling. The performer steps onto the platform. On cue, the brake is removed allowing the counterweights to fall. The performer is thrust through the star trapdoor. When the platform hits the highest point the performer leaps upward clearing the trapdoor sections, which then fall back into position at floor level. With a puff of smoke, the illusion is complete. Then in reverse, the flats open and Mr. Simple descends. Do you understand all that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; said Agatha cautiously. &#x201c;How do you know all this?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The Mothers&#x2019; Union was given a tour of the hall earlier this year to show how it had been used back in the Victorian days. The blacksmith gave us a lecture on the trap.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you think someone tampered with the brakes so that the platform would go down extra fast?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe. But it went down pretty fast anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How does anyone get in under the stage? Is there an outside door?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can get through under the platform at the front. I know that. But whether there is another entrance, I can&#x2019;t say. I know Bert only made one entrance through the trap, so it could have been tampered with any time earlier.&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha lit a cigarette and watched the smoke drift up towards the kitchen ceiling. &#x201c;Wait a minute. In order for Bert to disappear, someone below the stage must have operated the elevator.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I gather that the stage manager pressed a button at the side of the stage, which opened the trap and sent the green smoke up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But the stage manager&#x2014;or Gareth Craven, the producer&#x2014;surely checked on the apparatus before the show.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If things went all right at the dress rehearsal, Mrs. Raisin, maybe a check wasn&#x2019;t considered necessary,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>We really should start to call each other by our first names, thought Agatha. We called each other by our second names in the Ladies Society. But the society is long gone.</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the spike, or whatever it was that killed Bert?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that. Someone must have really hated him,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby. &#x201c;Such an elaborate way of killing him!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The blacksmith must be the obvious culprit,&#x201d; said Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;I believe he is a quiet, sensitive man,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, well,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to leave this one to the police. I&#x2019;ve got my own business to run and I can&#x2019;t see anyone in Winter Parva wanting to pay me to investigate the murder of a baker.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>On a Monday morning, a week later, Agatha, as usual, greeted her staff before settling down to have her usual breakfast at her desk&#x2014;one cup of strong black coffee and two cigarettes. Her staff consisted of young, blond and beautiful Toni Gilmour; white-haired gentle Phil Marshall; lugubrious ex-policeman Patrick Mulligan; young Simon Black with his jester&#x2019;s face; and secretary, Mrs. Freedman. Simon had left briefly to work for another agency when he thought Toni had resigned. But when he heard Toni had returned, he had promptly asked for his job back. Agatha did not like Simon much, but had rehired him in a weak moment.</p> <p>Agatha blew out a smoke ring. Mrs. Freedman gave an admonitory cough and switched on an extractor fan she had insisted on having installed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;Toni and Simon, you have Mrs. Fairly&#x2019;s case. She wants proof of her husband&#x2019;s infidelity. Phil and Patrick, you&#x2019;ve got two missing teenagers. You&#x2019;ve got their details and photographs?&#x201d;</p> <p>Both nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Berry&#x2019;s supermarket. Valuable goods have been disappearing from their electronics section and so far there&#x2019;s been nothing on their CCTV cameras. I&#x2019;m going to spend the day there.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; said Toni. &#x201c;Might be something interesting.&#x201d; Toni hoped it might be a job that she could do on her own. She did not like working with Simon. He was constantly asking her out on dates and she found it all embarrassing.</p> <p>The door opened and a man Agatha recognised as Gareth Craven walked in. He was even better looking than Agatha remembered. She did a frantic mental check. Did she have coffee-stained teeth? Had her lipstick faded? Why had she opted for trousers and flat shoes?</p> <p>Gareth Craven was a tall man with thick brown hair, clear grey eye...</p></p><h2>Judas And the Gospel of Jesus: Have We Missed the Truth About Christianity?</h2><p>Joining many other recently found and publicized &#34;gospels,&#34; the Gospel of Judas has found its way into the limelight as the subject of some recently published books and some recent television programming. The ancient manuscript is genuine-so what are Christians to make of the claims therein? Claims such as -Judas was doing what Jesus asked him to do when he betrayed Jesus -Jesus came to offer secret knowledge of how to escape this earthly world, rather than to usher in God&#39;s kingdom on earth -Jesus felt no pain on the cross -and more This timely and necessary response to the Gospel of Judas is the authoritative, orthodox word on what it really tells us--and does not tell us--about Jesus, Judas, early Christianity, and Gnosticism. Tom Wright, as both a bishop and an historian, is uniquely qualified to speak on the subject and answers the questions Christians have after encountering this &#34;new gospel.&#34;</p><p>FRONT FLAP I am writing this little book to make three points. First, this new &#34;Gospel of Judas,&#34; while a spectacularly interesting archaeological find, tells us nothing about the real Jesus, or for that matter the real Judas. In particular, it doesn&#39;t (as some have claimed) &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Judas over against either the charges laid against him in the New Testament or the anti-Jewish use that was made of the Judas tradition in the Middle Ages. Second, the enthusiasm for this new &#34;gospel&#34; lays bare the real agenda which has been driving both what we might call the scholarly &#34;Quest for an Alternative Jesus&#34; and also the popular eagerness for such sensational material that we find in books like Dan Brown&#39;s The Da Vinci Code. Third, the specific teaching of the &#34;Gospel of Judas&#34; only serves to highlight certain features about first-century Christianity that need to be drawn out more fully than is sometimes done. BACK FLAP Tom Wright is the bishop of Durham in the Church of England. Recently named by Christianity Today as one of the top five theologians in the world, Wright has taught New Testament studies for twenty years at Cambridge, Oxford, and McGill universities. He is the author of The Original Jesus, What Saint Paul Really Said, and The Challenge of Jesus.What does the Gospel of Judas really tell us? Joining other recently found and publicized &#34;gospels,&#34; the Gospel of Judas has found its way into the limelight. The ancient manuscript appears to be genuine--so what are we to make of the claims therein? Claims such as -Judas was doing what Jesus asked him to do when he betrayed Jesus -Jesus came to offer secret knowledge of how to escape this earthly world, rather than to usher in God&#39;s kingdom on earth -Jesus felt no pain on the cross -and more This timely response to the Gospel of Judas is the authoritative, orthodox word on what the Gospel of Judas really tells us--and does not tell us-about Jesus, Judas, early Christianity, and Gnosticism. Tom Wright, as both a bishop and a historian, is uniquely qualified to speak on the subject. In Judas and the Gospel of Jesus, he clearly and fairly answers your questions about this &#34;new gospel.&#34;</p><h2>The Fourth Hand</h2><p><b>The Fourth Hand</b> asks an interesting question: "How can anyone identify a dream of the future?" The answer: "Destiny is not imaginable, except in dreams or to those in love."<br><br>While reporting a story from India, a New York television journalist has his left hand eaten by a lion; millions of TV viewers witness the accident. In Boston, a renowned hand surgeon awaits the opportunity to perform the nation's first hand transplant; meanwhile, in the distracting aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, the surgeon is seduced by his housekeeper. A married woman in Wisconsin wants to give the one-handed reporter her husband's left hand-that is, after her husband dies. But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.<br><br>This is how John Irving's tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end,<b> The Fourth Hand</b> is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving's previous novels-including <b>The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany</b>, and <b>A Widow for One Year</b>-or his Oscar-winning screenplay of <b>The Cider House Rules</b>.<br><br><b>The Fourth Hand</b> is characteristic of John Irving's seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author's recurring themes-loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change.</p><p>Like anything newsworthy, miracles of medicine and technology inevitably make their way out of the headlines and become the stuff of fiction. In recent years readers have been absorbed by media accounts of a transplanted hand, an experiment that ultimately ended in amputation. Medical ethicists reason that a hand, unlike a heart or a liver--essential organs conveniently housed out of sight--is in full view and one of a pair, arguably dispensable. In his 10th novel, however, John Irving undertakes to imagine just such a transplant, which involves a donor, a recipient, a surgeon, a particular Green Bay Packer fan, and the remarkable left hand that brings them together.<p> Television reporter Patrick Wallingford becomes a story himself when he loses his hand to a caged lion while in India covering a circus. The moment is captured live on film, and Patrick (who wears a "perpetual but dismaying smile--the look of someone who knows he's met you before but can't recall the exact occasion") is henceforth known as the lion guy. Before long, plans are made to equip Patrick with a new hand. Doctor Nicholas M. Zajac, superstar surgeon, indefatigable dog-poop scooper, runner, and part-time father, is poised to perform the operation. But the donor--or rather the widow of the donor--has a few stipulations. Doris Clausen wants to meet the one-handed reporter before the procedure, and insists on visitation rights afterward. Irving weaves these characters and a panoply of others together in a smart, funny, readable narrative. Often farcical, <i>The Fourth Hand</i> is ultimately something more: a tender chronicle of the redemptive power of love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i></p>&#x201c;A RICH AND DEEPLY MOVING TALE . . .

Decades later, Leigh Fermor told the story of that life-changing journey in <i>A Time of Gifts </i>and <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i>, two books now celebrated as among the most vivid, absorbing, and beautifully written travel books of all time.<br><br><i>The Broken Road </i>is the long-awaited account of the final leg of his youthful adventure that Leigh Fermor promised but was unable to finish before his death in 2011. Assembled from Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s manuscripts by his prizewinning biographer Artemis Cooper and the travel writer Colin Thubron, this is perhaps the most personal of all Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s books, catching up with young Paddy in the fall of 1934 and following him through Bulgaria and Romania to the coast of the Black Sea. Days and nights on the road, spectacular landscapes and uncanny cities, friendships lost and found, leading the high life in Bucharest or camping out with fishermen and shepherds&#x2013;in the <i>The Broken Road</i> such incidents and escapades are described with all the linguistic bravura, odd and astonishing learning, and overflowing exuberance that Leigh Fermor is famous for, but also with a melancholy awareness of the passage of time, especially when he meditates on the scarred history of the Balkans or on his troubled relations with his father. The book ends, perfectly, with Paddy&#x2019;s arrival in Greece, the country he would fall in love with and fight for. Throughout it we can still hear the ringing voice of an irrepressible young man embarking on a life of adventure.</p><p><b>Patrick Leigh Fermor</b> (1915&#x2013;2011) was an intrepid traveler and a heroic soldier who is widely considered to be one of the finest travel writers of the twentieth century. After his stormy schooldays, followed by the walk across Europe to Constantinople that begins in <i>A Time of Gifts </i>(1977) and continues through <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i> (1986) and <i>The Broken Road </i>(published posthumously in 2013), he lived and traveled in the Balkans and the Greek archipelago. His books <i>Mani</i> (1958) and <i>Roumeli</i> (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. Leigh Fermor lived partly in Greece&#x2014;in the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani&#x2014;and partly in Worcestershire.

The greatest pleasure of all, as usual, is Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s own infectious, Rabelaisian hunger for knowledge of almost every kind. His memory seems eidetic; his eyes miss nothing. He seems to carry within himself a whole troupe of sharp-eyed geographers, art historians, ethnologists and multilingual poets.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert F. Worth, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Fermor&#x2019;s gift of observation transcends time, fusing the classical with the modern in prose of voluminous richness.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert D.

The 18-year-old Fermor began by sleeping in barns but, after meeting some landowners early on, got occasional introductions to castles. So he experienced life from both sides, and with all the senses, absorbing everything: flora and fauna, art and architecture, geography, clothing, music, foods, religions, languages. Writing the book decades after the fact, in a baroque style that is always rigorous, never flowery, he was able to inject historical depth while still retaining the feeling of boyish enthusiasm and boundless curiosity. This is the first of a still uncompleted trilogy; the second volume, <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i>, takes him through Hungary and Romania; together they capture better than any books I know the remedial, intoxicating joy of travel." &#x2014; Thomas Swick, <i>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Recovers the innocence and the excitement of youth, when everything was possible and the world seemed luminescent with promise. ...Even more magical...through Hungary, its lost province of Transylvania, and into Romania... sampling the tail end of a languid, urbane and anglophile way of life that would soon be swept away forever.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jeremy Lewis, <i>Literary Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;A book so good you resent finishing it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Norman Stone<br><br>"The greatest of living travel writers...an amazingly complex and subtle evocation of a place that is no more." &#x2014; Jan Morris <br><br> "In these two volumes of extraordinary lyrical beauty and discursive, staggering erudition, Leigh Fermor recounted his first great excursion... They&#x2019;re partially about an older author&#x2019;s encounter with his young self, but they&#x2019;re mostly an evocation of a lost Mitteleuropa of wild horses and dark forests, of ancient synagogues and vivacious Jewish coffeehouses, of Hussars and Uhlans, and of high-spirited and deeply eccentric patricians with vast libraries (such as the Transylvanian count who was a famous entomologist specializing in Far Eastern moths and who spoke perfect English, though with a heavy Scottish accent, thanks to his Highland nanny). These books amply display Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s keen eye and preternatural ear for languages, but what sets them apart, besides the utterly engaging persona of their narrator, is his historical imagination and intricate sense of historical linkage...Few writers are as alive to the persistence of the past (he&#x2019;s ever alert to the historical forces that account for the shifts in custom, language, architecture, and costume that he discerns), and I&#x2019;ve read none who are so sensitive to the layers of invasion that define the part of Europe he depicts here. The unusual vantage point of these books lends them great poignancy, for we and the author know what the youthful Leigh Fermor cannot: that the war will tear the scenery and shatter the buildings he evokes; that German and Soviet occupation will uproot the beguiling world of those Tolstoyan nobles; and that in fact very few people who became his friends on this marvelous and sunny journey will survive the coming catastrophe." &#x2014; Benjamin Schwarz, <i>The Atlantic<br><br></i><br>"Those for whom Paddy&#x2019;s prose is still an undiscovered country are to be envied for what lies ahead-hours with one of the most buoyant and curious personalities one can find in English." &#x2014; <i>The New York Sun</i> <br><br> "Mr. Fermor...is a peerless companion, unbound by timetable or convention, relentless in his high spirits and curiosity." &#x2014; Richard B. Woodward, <i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "We are aware at every step that his adventure can never be duplicated: only this extraordinary person at this pivotal time could have experienced and recorded many of these sights. Distant lightening from events in Germany weirdly illuminates the trail of this free spirit." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "The young Fermor appears to have been as delightful a traveling companion as the much older Fermor a raconteur." &#x2014; <i>The Houston Chronicle</i> <br><br>"[<i>A Time of Gifts</i>, <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i>] are absolutely delightful volumes, both for those who want to better understand what was lost in the violence of Europe&#x2019;s 20th-century divisions and for those who appreciate the beauty and thrill of travel writing at its best." &#x2014; <i>The Houston Chronicle</i> <br><br> "Leigh Fermor is recognizably that figure many writers of the past century have yearned to be, the man of action." &#x2014; <i>The Guardian</i> <br><br> "He was, and remains, an Englishman, with so much living to his credit that the lives conducted by the rest of us seem barely sentient-pinched and paltry things, laughably provincial in their scope, and no more fruitful than sleepwalks.

In Putin's autocratic Russia, the Revolution itself is considered a crime, and its anniversary was largely ignored. In stark contrast, the centenary of the massacre of the Imperial Family was commemorated in 2018 by a huge ceremony attended by the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>While the murders themselves have received major attention, what has never been investigated in detail are the various plots and plans behind the scenes to save the family<b>&#x2015;</b>on the part of their royal relatives, other governments, and Russian monarchists loyal to the Tsar. Rappaport refutes the claim that the fault lies entirely with King George V, as has been the traditional view for the last century. The responsibility for failing the Romanovs must be equally shared. The question of asylum for the Tsar and his family was an extremely complicated issue that presented enormous political, logistical and geographical challenges at a time when Europe was still at war. </p><p>Like a modern day detective, Helen Rappaport draws on new and never-before-seen sources from archives in the US, Russia, Spain and the UK, creating a powerful account of near misses and close calls with a heartbreaking conclusion. With its up-to-the-minute research, <i>The Race to Save the Romanovs</i> is sure to replace outdated classics as the final word on the fate of the Romanovs.</p></p><p>HELEN RAPPAPORT is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Romanov Sisters</i>.

Lee&#39;s greatest victory; Stephen W. Sears doesn&#39;t necessarily agree, and in this painstakingly researched book, he offers ample evidence that Lee had luck on his side in the battle. Lee was a great general all right, and his men did fight savagely. But the notion that Union General Joseph Hooker was inept is cast into doubt by Sears, who describes the action of Chancellorsville as most great battle books do--hour by hour. This book is the finest rendition of the battle yet and an interesting thesis for Civil War discussion. Lee&#39;s penchant for aggressiveness and his faith in his troops as unbeatable may have worked at Chancellorsville, but Sears argues that these alone couldn&#39;t win the war. Lee learned this lesson too, a month later at Gettysburg.STEPHEN W. SEARS is the author of many award-winning books on the Civil War, including Gettysburg and Landscape Turned Red.

In &#x201c;Human Moments in World War III,&#x201d; two men orbiting the earth, charged with gathering intelligence and reporting to Colorado Command, hear the voices of American radio, from a half century earlier. In the title story, Sisters Edgar and Grace, nuns working the violent streets of the South Bronx, confirm the neighborhood&#x2019;s miracle, the apparition of a dead child, Esmeralda. <br><br>Nuns, astronauts, athletes, terrorists and travelers, the characters in <i>The Angel Esmeralda </i>propel themselves into the world and define it. DeLillo&#x2019;s sentences are instantly recognizable, as original as the splatter of Jackson Pollock or the luminous rectangles of Mark Rothko. These nine stories describe an extraordinary journey of one great writer whose prescience about world events and ear for American language changed the literary landscape.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: Don DeLillo, a master of using exactly as many words as he needs to paint the sharpest possible picture, has published his first story collection. Written between 1979 and 2011, the nine short pieces in <em>The Angel Esmeralda</em> sketch a handful of moments--the arc of a circumstantial affair, the explosion of a friendship between two teenagers--with the author&#x2019;s trademark economy. DeLillo knows his context and characters so well, a sliver of them is enough to engage us completely. As one man puts it, floating through space in the collection opener, &#x201c;The emptier the land, the more luminous and precise the names for its features.&#x201d; DeLillo&#x2019;s short fiction is a series of pointillist landscapes; entire worlds spring from the section of the canvas he chooses to frame for us. Lean in and pay attention--every glimpse counts. <em>--Mia Lipman</em><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Sam Lipsyte Reviews <em>The Angel Esmeralda</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Sam Lipsyte is the author of <em>Venus Drive</em> and <em>The Ask</em>.<br></strong> <p> </p> <p>A note about <em>The Angel Esmeralda</em>: this collection of stories by America's best living novelist is not only an immense joy to read, but it grants one a chance to reflect on something often underappreciated: Don DeLillo's versatility. If you count yourself a DeLillo fan, then you are already intimate with the power, scope and heady, subterranean humor of novels like <em>Underworld</em>, <em>Players</em>, <em>Libra</em>, and <em>White Noise</em>, (well, really, any of his novels apply). You are probably also quite familiar with his wonderfully inventive plays. You've also read his short stories as they appeared infrequently over the years, been dazzled by their surfaces and depths, but maybe overlooked DeLillo's real achievement in the form. I admit I was dazzled, and that I partook in some egregious overlooking, but reading this collection confirms DeLillo as one of our very best short story writers. It's scary. </p> <p>All of these pieces possess the same cunning, grace and laser-guided prose of his novels, and touch on the great DeLillo themes. "Human Moments in World War III" depicts some pilots in a futuristic fighter during an age when "the banning of nuclear weapons has made the earth safe for war." As the ship describes its orbit the narrator describes his frightful observations about the world, while clinging to "homey emotions" summoned by the voices of old radio shows and a shipment of brightly packaged broccoli. Meanwhile he practices his firing protocol for the devastation to come. </p> <p>Other more recent fictions include "Baader-Meinhof," a brilliant meditation on terrorism, or our perceptions of it, as well "Midnight in Dostoevsky," which captures the sensitivity and intensity of young philosophy students at a remote college: "At the gym I did my dumb struts on the elliptical and lapsed into spells of lost thought. Idaho, I thought. Idaho, the word, so voweled and obscure. Wasn't where we were, right here, obscure enough for her?" The startling "Hammer and Sickle," about a cellblock of white-collar convicts, and "The Starveling," a heart breaker about obsessed, lonely moviegoers, round out this stunning book. </p> <p> There is no ignoring the collections subtitle, "Nine Stories," with its nod (and wry challenge) to J.D. Salinger's classic. It's strange to put DeLillo and Salinger in the same sentence. They are so vastly different, except they both, in their respective eras, hugely shaped the sound and direction of American literature. I've read Don DeLillo over and over for more than half my life (it's always more than half, DeLillo might point out, for he has one of the finest ears for the patterns of American speech). The richness of his work, the pleasures on offer--intellectual, visceral, poetic, comic&#x2013;-are unrivaled. The connections he makes from the data of our lives, and the way he renders these connections into sly, steely, grieving song, remain incomparable. Which is just to say that, in the parlance of this e-commerce context, customers who like writing that stretches and reinvigorates their consciousness, that delivers them bravely to places of fresh feeling and leads them thrillingly through the mysteries and moods of contemporary existence might also enjoy <em>The Angel Esmeralda</em>. <em>--Sam Lipsyte</em></p>Don DeLillo is the author of 15 novels--including <i>Falling Man, Libra,</i> and <i>White Noise</i>--and three plays. He has won the National Book Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction, and the Jerusalem Prize.

Original.</p><p>Jodi Thomas is a certified marriage and family counselor, a fifth generation Texan, a Texas Tech graduate, and writer-in-residence at West Texas A&amp;M University. She lives in Amarillo, Texas.While Thomas recently made a splash with two contemporary novels, <i>The Widows of Wichita County</i> and <i>Finding Mary Blaine</i>, it's her nearly 20 historical romances, set in her native state of Texas, that have earned her two RITA awards. This psychologically, as well as physically, action-packed tale demonstrates why. Third in her Wife Lottery series (after <i>The Texan's Wager</i> and <i>When a Texan Gambles</i>), it follows the fortunes of 15-year-old orphan Lacy Larson, youngest of a gutsy trio of pioneer women auctioned off to avoid jail after killing Zeb Whittaker, an avaricious buffalo hunter who'd attacked them. For mysterious reasons, Walker Larson, Lacy's married-by-proxy army captain hubby, doesn't want a wife, much less one his father has purchased for him. But when Zeb Whittaker turns up alive five years later, desiring revenge, the reluctant absentee groom is assigned to protect Lacy. The result is a tale with more than enough fast-paced adventure to satisfy suspense buffs. But, as always, it is Thomas's slower-paced handling of the romantic dynamics between her emotionally warm but wounded characters that is the novel's strength. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gates takes us from the sixteenth century through the ordeal of slavery, from the Civil War and Reconstruction through the Jim Crow era and the Great Migration; from the civil rights and black nationalist movements through the age of hip-hop to the Joshua generation. By documenting and illuminating the sheer diversity of African American involvement in American history, society, politics, and culture, Gates bracingly disabuses us of the presumption of a single &#x201c;black experience.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Life Upon These Shores</i>&nbsp;is a book of major importance, a breathtaking tour de force of the historical imagination.</p><p><b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b>, is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard University. He is editor in chief of the Oxford African American Studies Center and of the daily online magazine <i>The Root</i>. He has received more than forty honorary degrees from institutions the world over.INTRODUCTION<br><i>Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored without wages; they made cotton king . . .&#x2014;and yet out of a bottomless vitality, they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail . . . because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America&#x2019;s destiny.</i><br><br>&#x2014;Martin Luther King, Jr. &#x201c;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&#x201d; April 16, 1963<br><br>In <i>Life Upon These Shores</i>, I set out to picture African American history, to find a new way of looking at its full sweep. I imagined a book with an abundance of images of the great and small events and of the signifi cant individuals who shaped the heritage of the African American people and the history of our nation. <i>Life Upon These Shores: Looking at African American History</i> draws upon a treasury of illustrations at once to visualize and to write the history of black people in America, which begins as early as 1513, when the free black conquistador Juan Garrido accompanied Ponce de Le�n on his first expedition to Florida. So the book ranges from the exploration of the New World and the long ordeal of slavery through Emancipation and the Civil War; from the era of Reconstruction through Jim Crow and World War I; from the Great Migration of 1910 to 1930&#x2014;including the Harlem Renaissance and the Jazz Age&#x2014; through the Great Depression and World War II; from the civil rights movement and its aftermath, and the Black Power insurgence, on to the age of hip-hop and the rise of the Joshua Generation, leading to the election of the first African American president of the United States. <i>Life Upon These Shores</i> illustrates the richness of this history through ancient maps, manuscripts and documents, portraits, postcards, posters, sheet music, cartoons, drawings and photographs, and even film stills.<br><br>We have combed through more than four hundred years of public records and private collections for the names, stories, and images of not only well-known African Americans but also others who have been consigned to oblivion even as they too were instrumental in shaping African American history day to day. To be sure, here are the transcendent personalities: among many, Phillis Wheatley, Sojourner Truth, Henry Highland Garnet, Harriet Tubman, Anna Julia Cooper, Ida B. Wells, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Madam C. J. Walker, Jack Johnson and Joe Louis, W. E. B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker, George Schulyer, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe, Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, Elijah Muhammad and Muhammad Ali, Adam Clayton Powell, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, John Lewis, James Meredith, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, James Baldwin, Eldridge Cleaver, Huey P. Newton, Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown, James Brown, Amiri Baraka, Shirley Chisholm, Jesse Jackson, Michael Jackson and Prince, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Barack Obama. Their vaunted contributions to politics, sports, literature, the arts, religion, and education have indelibly colored the canvas of American culture and society. But this book also aims in part to restore to the historical record the names and achievements of significant men and women long forgotten: among them Onesimus, the slave who taught Cotton Mather to inoculate the Massachusetts colony against smallpox; the pre&#x2013;Civil War, wildly popular black ventriloquist and magician Richard Potter; Stagecoach Mary, a post&#x2013; Civil War driver for Wells Fargo; and the famous cowboy Deadwood Dick.<br><br>As I have studied the remarkable visual depictions collected in Life Upon These Shores, I have been struck by the sheer diversity of African American expression throughout our nation&#x2019;s history&#x2014; how there has never been only one way to be black, religiously, politically, socially, artistically, professionally, sexually, or stylistically. I have tried to showcase the multiplicity of cultural institutions, political strategies, and religious and social perspectives defi ning black culture and society from slavery to freedom, from the plantation to the White House. Although, for example, debates between such central figures as Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, or Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., are familiar in the academy, they remain largely unknown to the general public, as do controversies involving their lesser-known peers; the latter too have a place at the table. These and all the other images and stories in this book help us to understand the complexity of the African American people, the rich and honest diversity of opinion that has always characterized the black experience in America.<br><i><br>Life Upon These Shores</i> seeks not only to elucidate the pressing issues faced by each generation of African Americans but also to evoke the limitless variety of African American life: for instance, the experience of slavery in the North as opposed to slavery on a Southern plantation or in the West; the experience of being a freedperson as opposed to a slave; the experience of being a sharecropper in the South in the early twentieth century as opposed to a dockworker in Oakland or an autoworker in Detroit; the experience of being a black woman as opposed to a black man. Here are images of African Americans from different African ethnic groups dragged into slavery, forced to imagine new identities upon these shores; images of free blacks alongside their enslaved brethren in the South, forming their own religious, social, and cultural institutions in the North; images documenting the myriad ways in which some resisted slavery and segregation even as others sought accommodation, all the while forging family ties and communal bonds &#x201c;behind the veil,&#x201d; as W. E. B. Du Bois put it.<br><br>The illustrations also offer a glimpse at how global affairs infl uenced African American history. So it was that the Haitian Revolution (1791&#x2013;1804) sparked demands for the abolition of slavery and for equal rights up through the Civil War, while inspiring slave rebellions in America. A century and a half or so later, African movements for independence from colonialism informed the American civil rights movement, which in turn was to have a profound infl uence on the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa.<br><br>A collective visual history of persons of African descent in America since their arrival in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Life Upon These Shores&#x2014; by examining defi ning issues, controversies and debates, and the achievements of people who shaped the history day to day for more than four hundred years&#x2014;reveals, in all its human glory, the generally unacknowledged multifaceted nature of the black experience in these United States.<br><br>This is a general history for a general audience and relies on an enormous body of scholarly literature. The book stands on the shoulders of true giants. To retain its appeal, I have limited intrusive scholarly apparatus and identified sources only for direct quotes or for information not readily accessible. For those seeking verification of facts or additional information, one should consult the extended bibliography, which lists all of the major works used in this study.<br><br>Henry Louis Gates , Jr.<br>Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts<br>August 31, 2010</p><h2>The One Page Business Plan for the Creative Entrepreneur</h2><p>The Fastest, Easiest Way to Write a Business Plan!

These business owners are either starting up new businesses or reinventing established businesses. These individuals are intensely passionate and strategic. They are competitive, care about people, the environment, and their communities. They do not run their businesses casually. They are professional entrepreneurs. <p>There is also another type of entrepreneur, the accidental entrepreneur. These individuals are finding themselves considering self -employment for the first time in their lives. Many have experienced firsthand the downsizing of corporate America and are now ready to act on their own business ideas. </p><p>All these companies share similar issues. Business is complex, resources are limited, and time is of the essence. There is no room for big mistakes. Business owners can't know it all and can't do it all by themselves. Therefore, other people will become involved in the business. That means employees, independent contractors, investors, and potentially partners. Additionally, your business may require the use of "other people's money." Other people and "other people's money" necessitate having a written business plan. It's no longer optional. </p><p>The One Page Business Plan was inspired by my work with entrepreneurs. These individuals like to think fast and move fast, and the concept of a traditional business plan was out of the question. An innovative, fresh approach to business planning was required, and the One Page Business Plan was born.</p></p><h2>A Complicated Kindness</h2><p>The third novel by this Canadian author is a coming-of-age story which balances grief and hope through the voice of a witty teenager.</p><p>What Nomi Nickel needs most is a bus ticket out of town.

But Sherman Alexie's bond with his mother Lillian was more complex than most. She plunged her family into chaos with a drinking habit, but shed her addiction when it was on the brink of costing her everything. She survived a violent past, but created an elaborate facade to hide the truth. She selflessly cared for strangers, but was often incapable of showering her children with the affection that they so desperately craved. She wanted a better life for her son, but it was only by leaving her behind that he could hope to achieve it. It's these contradictions that made Lillian Alexie a beautiful, mercurial, abusive, intelligent, complicated, and very human woman.<br><br>When she passed away, the incongruities that defined his mother shook Sherman and his remembrance of her. Grappling with the haunting ghosts of the past in the wake of loss, he responded the only way he knew how: he wrote. The result is a stunning memoir filled with raw, angry, funny, profane, tender memories of a childhood few can imagine, much less survive. An unflinching and unforgettable remembrance, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME is a powerful, deeply felt account of a complicated relationship. <br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2017:</strong> Sherman Alexie's memoir, <em>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Say You Love Me</em>, is an extraordinary look at the complicated relationship between a remarkable mother and an equally remarkable son, set, mostly, in the Spokane Indian Reservation where Alexie spent his childhood. His whip-smart, sometimes cruel mother saved the family when she stopped drinking, but was inexplicably tough on her kids &#x2013; something Alexie traces back to mental illness, sexual assault, and the Indian experience of violence and oppression. Family memoirs often seem like an opportunity for score settling, but Alexie is so aware of his own fallible memory and his own imperfections that this one won&#x2019;t make you bristle. His style is idiosyncratic &#x2013; passages of verse lead to passages of prose -- but it&#x2019;s readable, unpretentious, funny and deeply compassionate. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>Winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction, a PEN/Hemingway Citation for Best First Fiction, and the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, Sherman Alexie is a poet, short story writer, novelist and performer. A Spokane/Couer d'Alene Indian, Alexie grew up in Wellpinit, Washington, on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Alexie has been an urban Indian since 1994 and lives in Seattle with his family. <br></p><h2>Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw</h2><p>The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney&#39;s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney&#39;s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year&#39;s Day (he resolves to &#34;help other people improve,&#34; telling his mother, &#34;I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly&#34;) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father&#39;s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg&#39;s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (&#34;Dear James, You smell&#34;), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team&#39;s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the &#34;racket&#34; children&#39;s book authors have going. &#34;All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.&#34; Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.

But suddenly his decadent existence ends when an all powerful alien race intent on the utter destruction of all intelligent life reappears after eons of silence, and threatens the lives of all heechee and humans.

Now allies, human and Heechee, are guarding against the Foe, a race of energy beings that has already wiped out several civilizations. Millionaire Robin Brodhead, who has survived his physical death to become a computer-stored intelligence, tracks suspicious Foe-directed transmissions back to a Pacific island and the refugee children who have unwittingly carried the Foe to Earth. Robin's first contact with these beings becomes vital to human and Heechee existence. Although Pohl relies rather heavily on cute aliens and wise-guy computer programs, his restless, loquacious narrator Robin whips the reader from planet to planet and from past to future, rapidly solving problems and just as rapidly shoveling up new ones in the best Pohl fashion. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>God&#39;s Little Devotional Journal for Women (God&#39;s Little Devotional Book)</h2><p>While self-improvement is the operative word among today's gym-toned, preening population, it is obvious that our world's real need is the development of spiritual muscles.

His vision was soon realized: At its height, the Ottoman realm extended from Hungary to the Persian Gulf, from North Africa to the Caucasus. The Ottoman Empire was one of the largest and most influential empires in world history. For centuries, Europe watched with fear as the Ottomans steadily advanced their rule across the Balkans. Yet travelers and merchants were irresistibly drawn toward Ottoman lands by their fascination with the Orient and the lure of profit. Although it survived for over six centuries, the history of the Ottoman Empire is too often colored by the memory of its bloody final throes. In this magisterial work Caroline Finkel lucidly recounts the epic story of the Ottoman Empire from its origins in the thirteenth century through its destruction on the battlefields of World War I.</p><p><b>Caroline Finkel</b> has lived in Istanbul for many years and traveled widely in Turkey and the former Ottoman lands. She has a doctorate in Ottoman history from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. <i>Osman's Dream</i> is her third book. She currently divides her time between Istanbul and London.What Finkel calls the "old" narrative of the Ottoman Empire is simple to relate: "it rose, declined, and fell." An exotic parade of salacious sultans, grand viziers and duplicitous eunuchs inhabit the sultry harems and domed palaces of Istanbul&#x2014;at least in our imaginations. Finkel, a long-time resident of Turkey and Ottoman scholar, relates a "new" narrative of empire that properly accounts for the richness and complexity of the Ottoman state over nearly seven centuries. By presiding over their multiethnic empire for so long, and ushering it from medievalism to modernity, the Ottomans should be ranked alongside the Hapsburgs and the Romanovs, she argues. That they are overlooked is the fault of Western historians who have peered at their subjects through the lens of their own prejudices. Finkel's striking innovation is to turn a mirror on the Ottomans and examine how they saw themselves and their empire. While this approach yields a refreshingly original perspective, Finkel's quest to improve Westerners' understanding occasionally leads her into some questionable stretches (an implication, for instance, that Westerners think all Muslims are terrorists). Happily, these remain unintrusive and this history makes a riveting and enjoyable read for all audiences. 16 pages of photos; maps. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is only in recent decades that the confusions, disorientations and very different world views that arise as a result of communication have become an independent field of research.

But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was&#x2013;and its true nature could change the modern world.<br><br>Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts&#x2013;and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he&#x2019;d left behind.<br><br>It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton&#x2019;s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who&#x2019;s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she&#x2019;s not alone.

He was sitting at a table outside the Caf� Nikolaj, comfortable in a white lattice chair. The sunny afternoon was pleasant and H�jbro Plads, the popular Danish square that spanned out before him, bristled with people. The caf� was doing its usual brisk business&#x2014;the mood feverish&#x2014;and for the past half hour he&#x2019;d been waiting for Stephanie.<br><br> She was a petite woman, in her sixties, though she never confirmed her age and the Justice Department personnel records that Malone once saw contained only a winking n/a in the space reserved for date of birth. Her dark hair was streaked with waves of silver, and her brown eyes offered both the compassionate look of a liberal and the fiery glint of a prosecutor. Two presidents had tried to make her attorney general, but she&#x2019;d turned both offers down. One attorney general had lobbied hard to fire her&#x2014;especially after she was enlisted by the FBI to investigate him&#x2014;but the White House nixed the idea since, among other things, Stephanie Nelle was scrupulously honest.<br><br> In contrast, the man with the knife was short and stout, with narrow features and brush-cut hair. Something haunted loomed on his East European face&#x2014;a forlornness that worried Malone more than the glistening blade&#x2014;and he was dressed casually in denim pants and a blood-red jacket.<br><br> Malone rose from his seat but kept his eyes trained on Stephanie.<br><br> He thought of shouting a warning, but she was too far away and there was too much noise between them. His view of her was mo- mentarily blocked by one of the modernistic sculptures that dotted H�jbro Plads&#x2014;this one of an obscenely obese woman, lying naked on her belly, her obtrusive buttocks rounded like windswept mountains. When Stephanie appeared from the other side of the cast bronze, the man with the knife had moved closer and Malone watched as he severed a strap that draped her left shoulder, jerked a leather bag free, then shoved Stephanie to the flagstones.<br><br> A woman screamed and commotion erupted at the sight of a purse snatcher brandishing a knife.<br><br> Red Jacket rushed ahead, Stephanie&#x2019;s bag in hand, and shouldered people out of his way. A few pushed back. The thief angled left, around another of the bronzed sculptures, and finally broke into a run. His route seemed aimed at K�bmagergade, a pedestrian-only lane that twisted north, out of H�jbro Plads, deeper into the city&#x2019;s shopping district.<br><br> Malone bounded from the table, determined to cut off the assailant before he could turn the corner, but a cluster of bicycles blocked his way. He circled the cycles and sprinted forward, partially orbiting a fountain before tackling his prey.<br><br> They slammed into hard stone, Red Jacket taking most of the impact, and Malone immediately noticed that his opponent was muscular. Red Jacket, undaunted by the attack, rolled once, then brought a knee into Malone&#x2019;s stomach.<br><br> The breath left him in a rush and his guts churned.<br><br> Red Jacket sprang to his feet and raced up K�bmagergade.<br><br> Malone stood, but instantly crouched over and sucked a couple of shallow breaths.<br><br> Damn. He was out of practice.<br><br> He caught hold of himself and resumed pursuit, his quarry now possessing a fifty-foot head start. Malone had not seen the knife during their struggle, but as he plowed up the street between shops he saw that the man still grasped the leather bag. His chest burned, but he was closing the gap.<br><br> Red Jacket wrenched a flower cart away from a scraggly old man, one of many carts that lined both H�jbro Plads and K�bmagergade. Malone hated the vendors, who enjoyed blocking his bookshop, especially on Saturdays. Red Jacket flung the cart down the cobbles in Malone&#x2019;s direction. He could not let the cart run free&#x2014;too many people on the street, including children&#x2014;so he darted right, grasped hold, and twisted it to a stop.<br><br> He glanced back and saw Stephanie round the corner onto K�bmagergade, along with a policeman. They were half a football field away, and he had no time to wait.<br><br> Malone dashed ahead, wondering where the man was heading. Perhaps he&#x2019;d left a vehicle, or a driver was waiting where K�bmagergade emptied into another of Copenhagen&#x2019;s busy squares, Hauser Plads. He hoped not. That place was a nightmare of congestion, beyond the web of people-only lanes that formed the shoppers&#x2019; mecca known as Str�get. His thighs ached from the unexpected workout, the muscles barely recalling his days with the Navy and the Justice Department. After a year of voluntary retirement, his exercise regimen would not impress his former employer.<br><br> Ahead loomed the Round Tower, nestled firmly against the Trinity Church like a thermos bound to a lunch pail. The burly cylindrical structure rose nine stories. Denmark&#x2019;s Christian IV had erected it in 1642, and the symbol of his reign&#x2014;a gilded 4 embraced by a c&#x2014; glistened on its somber brick edifice. Five streets intersected where the Round Tower stood, and Red Jacket could choose any one of them for his escape.<br><br> Police cars appeared.<br><br> One screeched to a stop on the south side of the Round Tower. Another came from farther down K�bmagergade, blocking any escape to the north. Red Jacket was now contained in the plaza that encircled the Round Tower. His quarry hesitated, seeming to appraise the situation, then scampered right and disappeared inside the Round Tower.<br><br> What was the fool doing? There was no way out besides the ground-floor portal. But maybe Red Jacket didn&#x2019;t know that.<br><br> Malone ran to the entrance. He knew the man in the ticket booth. The Norwegian spent many hours in Malone&#x2019;s bookshop, English literature his passion.<br><br> &#x201c;Arne, where did that man go?&#x201d; he asked in Danish, catching his wind.<br><br> &#x201c;Ran right by without paying.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anybody up there?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;An older couple went up a little while ago.&#x201d;<br><br> No elevator or stairs led to the top. Instead, a spiral causeway wound a path straight to the summit, originally installed so that bulky seventeenth-century astronomical instruments could be wheeled up. The story local tour guides liked to tell was of how Russia&#x2019;s Peter the Great once rode up on horseback while his empress followed in a carriage.<br><br> Malone could hear footfalls echoing from the flooring above. He shook his head at what he knew awaited him. &#x201c;Tell the police we&#x2019;re up there.&#x201d;<br><br> He started to run.<br><br> Halfway up the spiraling incline he passed a door leading into the Large Hall. The glassed entrance was locked, the lights off. Ornamented double windows lined the tower&#x2019;s outer walls, but each was iron-barred. He listened again and could still hear running from above.<br><br> He continued ahead, his breathing growing thick and hampered. He slowed his pace when he passed a medieval planet plotter affixed high on the wall. He knew the exit onto the roof platform was just a few feet away, around the ramp&#x2019;s final bend.<br><br> He heard no more footsteps.<br><br> He crept forward and stepped through the archway. An octago- nal observatory&#x2014;not from Christian IV&#x2019;s time, but a more recent incarnation&#x2014;rose in the center, with a wide terrace encircling.<br><br> To his left a decorative iron fence surrounded the observatory, its only entrance chained shut. On his right, intricate wrought-iron latticework lined the tower&#x2019;s outer edge. Beyond the low railing loomed the city&#x2019;s red-tiled rooftops and green spires.<br><br> He rounded the platform and found an elderly man lying prone. Behind the body, Red Jacket stood with a knife to an older woman&#x2019;s throat, his arm encasing her chest. She seemed to want to scream, but fear quelled her voice.<br><br> &#x201c;Keep still,&#x201d; Malone said to her in Danish.<br><br> He studied Red Jacket. The haunted look was still there in the dark, almost mournful eyes. Beads of sweat glistened in the bright sun. Everything signaled that Malone should not step any closer. Footfalls from below signaled that the police would arrive in a few moments.<br><br> &#x201c;How about you cool down?&#x201d; he asked, trying English.<br><br> He could see the man understood him, but the knife stayed in place. Red Jacket&#x2019;s gaze kept darting away, off to the sky then back. He seemed unsure of himself and that concerned Malone even more. Desperate people always did desperate things.<br><br> &#x201c;Put the knife down. The police are coming. There&#x2019;s no way out.&#x201d;<br><br> Red Jacket looked to the sky again, then refocused on Malone. Indecision stared back at him. What was this? A purse snatcher who flees to the top of a hundred-foot tower with nowhere to go?<br><br> Footfalls from below grew louder.<br><br> &#x201c;The police are here.&#x201d;<br><br> Red Jacket backed closer to the iron railing but kept his grip tight on the elderly woman. Malone sensed the steeliness of an ultimatum forcing some choice, so he made clear again, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way out.&#x201d;<br><br> Red Jacket tightened his grip on the woman&#x2019;s chest, then he staggered back, now firmly against the waist-high outer railing, nothing beyond him and his hostage but air.<br><br> The eyes lost their panic and a sudden calm swept over the man. He shoved the old woman forward and Malone caught her before she lost her balance. Red Jacket made the sign of the cross and, with Stephanie&#x2019;s bag in hand, pivoted out over the railing, screamed one word&#x2014;&#x201c;beauseant&#x201d;&#x2014;then slashed the knife across his throat...</p><h2>Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy&#39;s Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back, Deluxe Edition</h2><p><p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> best-seller with more than 11 million copies sold and Amazon&#x2019;s #17 best-selling book of all time. <em>Heaven Is for Real </em>was the best-selling non-fiction book of 2011 as reported by Nielsen&#x2019;s Bookscan, and it was made in to a major motion picture by Sony in 2014.</strong></p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember the hospital, Colton?&#x201d; Sonja said.&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, mommy, I remember,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where the&nbsp;angels sang to me.&#x201d;</p><p>When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family&nbsp;was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren&#x2019;t expecting, though,&nbsp;was the story that emerged in the months that followed&#x2014;a story as beautiful as it&nbsp;was extraordinary, detailing their little boy&#x2019;s trip to heaven and back.</p><p>Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the&nbsp;surgery&#x2013;and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were&nbsp;doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of&nbsp;visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he&nbsp;had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He&nbsp;also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that&nbsp;matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.</p><p>With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton&nbsp;tells of meeting long-departed family members.

Retold by his father,&nbsp;but using Colton&#x2019;s uniquely simple words,&nbsp;<em>Heaven Is for Real</em>&nbsp;offers a glimpse&nbsp;of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, &#x201c;Nobody is old and nobody&nbsp;wears glasses.&#x201d;</p><p><em>Heaven Is for Real</em>&nbsp;will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering&nbsp;the chance to see, and believe, like a child.</p><p>Continue the Burpos story in <em>Heaven Changes Everything: The Rest of Our Story</em>. <em>Heaven Is for Real </em>also is available in Spanish, <em>El cielo es real</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Todd Burpo is pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan and a volunteer fireman.

She&nbsp;worked for eleven years as a writer and editor at the national news biweekly&nbsp;WORLD&nbsp;magazine and is a U.S. Navy veteran.</p>Burpo, a Wesleyan pastor in rural Nebraska, recounts the story of his son&#39;s mystic vision of heaven while the youngster was suffering from a near-fatal illness in the spring of 2003. Through the course of the work, Burpo recalls conversations he had with his son about what heaven was like. Christians will be encouraged, non-Christians not at all. This work is written in a plain, conversational style that Dean Gallagher narrates with great skill. Gallagher reads at a pace that is never hurried, even when recalling stressful incidents. He is expressive, but never melodramatic, throughout the production--especially when relating the anguish Burpo and his wife felt at nearly losing their child. M.T.F. � AudioFile 2011, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Wordy Shipmates</h2><p><i>The Wordy Shipmates</i> is <i>New York Times</i>?bestselling author Sarah Vowell?s exploration of the Puritans and their journey to America to become the people of John Winthrop?s ?city upon a hill??a shining example, a ?city that cannot be hid.?<br><br> To this day, America views itself as a Puritan nation, but Vowell investigates what that means? and what it should mean. What was this great political enterprise all about? Who were these people who are considered the philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors of our nation? What Vowell discovers is something far different from what their uptight shoe-buckles-and- corn reputation might suggest. The people she finds are highly literate, deeply principled, and surprisingly feisty. Their story is filled with pamphlet feuds, witty courtroom dramas, and bloody vengeance. Along the way she asks:<br><br> * Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, a Christlike Christian, or conformity?s tyrannical enforcer? <i>Answer: Yes!</i><br> * Was Rhode Island?s architect, Roger Williams, America?s founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? <i>Same difference.</i><br> * What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? <i>A hatchet.</i><br> * What was the Puritans? pet name for the Pope? <i>The Great Whore of Babylon.</i><br><br> Sarah Vowell?s special brand of armchair history makes the bizarre and esoteric fascinatingly relevant and fun. She takes us from the modern-day reenactment of an Indian massacre to the Mohegan Sun casino, from old-timey Puritan poetry, where ?righteousness? is rhymed with ?wilderness,? to a Mayflower-themed waterslide. Throughout, <i>The Wordy Shipmates</i> is rich in historical fact, humorous insight, and social commentary by one of America?s most celebrated voices. Thou shalt enjoy it.<br><br></p><p><p>Sarah Vowell is the bestselling author of <i>The Wordy Shipmates</i>, <i>Assassination Vacation</i>, <i>The Partly Cloudy Patriot</i>, <i>Take the Cannoli</i>, and <i>Radio On</i>. A contributing editor for public radio&#x2019;s "This American Life", she lives in New York City.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Stephen Prothero Many young people today are allergic to history, even of the U.S. variety, and if you're foolish enough to steer them toward the colonial period, they start not just to sneeze but to retch. Sarah Vowell, a regular contributor to Chicago Public Radio's "This American Life," wants to make history go down easy. So she writes about the past with the irreverence of late-night television. Not long into The Wordy Shipmates, her new book on colonial New England and its aftereffects, we encounter not only such Puritan stalwarts as John Cotton and John Winthrop but also "The Brady Bunch," "Happy Days" and "The Simpsons." This approach yields a book that is as easy to read as The Fonz is to watch -- a book sprinkled with the sort of phrases and punctuation (exclamation points for example!) commonly found in text messages. But this breeziness also produces some simplistic arguments. Why do Americans see themselves as exceptional and ride that exceptionalism into war in Iraq? "Answer: Because Henry VIII had a crush on a woman who was not his wife." Still, Vowell gets a lot right. She is right to see the United States as a "Puritan nation"; the Puritans' influence over us did not die with the birth of the nation in the 1770s or even the birth of the counterculture in the 1960s. And she is right to understand the Puritans as perhaps the quintessential people of the book. The core premise of The Wordy Shipmates is that their "single-minded obsession with one book, the Bible, made words the center of their lives." What historian Perry Miller called the Puritans' "errand into the wilderness" was not primarily an economic or a political errand, Vowell argues. It was an errand in reading and writing and interpreting texts. The core text of this venture -- and of Vowell's book -- is John Winthrop's 1630 sermon "A Model of Christian Charity." Here Winthrop describes Massachusetts as "a city upon a hill" and sets in motion the sordid history of American exceptionalism -- a history that, according to Vowell, has vouchsafed to us (among other things) wars in the Philippines, Vietnam and Iraq. On first blush Vowell seems like an angry atheist set down at the historian's table. But under this anger is a good measure of empathy. Hers is not the narrative of an angry adolescent who never wants to return to her Pentecostal parents' home. It is the narrative of an adult who wants to see her American home for what it is -- and for what it has done to her, and to us. Central to Winthrop's "Christian Charity" was a "communitarian ethos" that Vowell admires. Breaking for one telling moment out of her oh-so-21st-century pose of Manhattanish irony, she refers to Winthrop's injunction to "delight in each other, make other's conditions our own, rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together" as "one of the most beautiful sentences in the English language." And at the end of the book she admits to falling in love with one side of Winthrop: "the Winthrop [whom] Cotton Mather celebrates for sharing his firewood with the needy, the Winthrop who scolds Thomas Dudley for overcharging the poor, the Winthrop of 'Christian Charity,' who called for 'enlargement toward others' and 'brotherly affection.' " Vowell, who was raised in Oklahoma and now lives in New York City, is part of what Republican candidates refer to as the East Coast elite, so it should not be surprising that the politics here is standard-fare liberal: President Reagan bad, Dr. King good. Bad of the Puritans to banish Anne Hutchinson -- "the Puritan Oprah" -- and to kill so many Indians in the Pequot War. To all of which, the Homer Simpson in me says, "D'oh!" Nonetheless, there are important historical points to make, and Vowell makes many of them well. At some moment between the time Winthrop delivered his famous sermon and Reagan was inaugurated, the covenant between Americans and God lost its "if" -- if you do mercy and seek justice, then God will bless you; but if you do otherwise, God will deliver punishment. We may be a Puritan nation, but what we have retained is only Puritanism's easy half. We are convinced that God blesses our endeavors, but we seldom consider that some of those endeavors are not worth blessing. And it never occurs to us that they might bring down upon us God's righteous anger. Vowell also makes something intriguing of the oft-discussed distinction between Winthrop and colonial New England's champion of religious liberty, Roger Williams. These two men, she observes, do not just embody the divide between "orthodox Massachusetts" and "madcap Rhode Island." They also illustrate what she calls "the fundamental conflict of American life" -- "between the body politic and the individual, between we the people and each person's pursuit of happiness." "At his city-on-a-hill best," Vowell writes in one of her book's best passages, "Winthrop is Pete Seeger, gathering a generation around the campfire to sing their shared folk songs. Williams is Bob Dylan plugging in at Newport, making his own noise." Vowell, whose other books include a quirky travelogue of sites related to the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley, obviously is partial to people who make their own noise. But to her credit, she also recognizes the dangers individualism poses to community. In the end, however, what makes The Wordy Shipmates float is not so much its arguments as its voice. Most writing on the Puritans is as dour as the Puritans themselves. Vowell has fun with them, and in the process, she helps us take seriously both their lives and their legacy. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

In the end, his life was saved by a German officer who heard him play the same Chopin Nocturne on a piano found among the rubble. Written immediately after the war and suppressed for decades, <i>The Pianist </i>is a stunning testament to human endurance and the redemptive power of fellow feeling.<br></p><p>Written immediately after the end of World War II, this morally complex Holocaust memoir is notable for its exact depiction of the grim details of life in Warsaw under the Nazi occupation. "Things you hardly noticed before took on enormous significance: a comfortable, solid armchair, the soothing look of a white-tiled stove," writes Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist for Polish radio when the Germans invaded. His mother's insistence on laying the table with clean linen for their midday meal, even as conditions for Jews worsened daily, makes palpable the Holocaust's abstract horror. Arbitrarily removed from the transport that took his family to certain death, Szpilman does not deny the "animal fear" that led him to seize this chance for escape, nor does he cheapen his emotions by belaboring them. Yet his cool prose contains plenty of biting rage, mostly buried in scathing asides (a Jewish doctor spared consignment to "the most wonderful of all gas chambers," for example). Szpilman found compassion in unlikely people, including a German officer who brought food and warm clothing to his hiding place during the war's last days. Extracts from the officer's wartime diary (added to this new edition), with their expressions of outrage at his fellow soldiers' behavior, remind us to be wary of general condemnation of any group. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[Szpilman's] account is hair-raising beyond anything Hollywood could invent...an altogether unforgettable book." -- <i>THE DAILY TELEGRAPH </i><p> "[Szpilman's] shock and ensuing numbness become ours, so that acts of ordinary kindness or humanity take on an aura of miracle. --<i>THE OBSERVER </i></p><p> "Rarely has the sheer claustrophobia of living in the Warsaw Ghetto been so vividly conveyed as it is by Szpilman." --<i>THE INDEPENDENT </i></p></p><h2>The Rook: A Novel (The Rook Files, 1)</h2><p><b>Now a Starz� Original Series</b><b><br></b><b>"Utterly convincing and engrossing---totally thought-through and frequently hilarious....Even this aging, jaded, attention-deficit-disordered critic was blown away." --Lev Grossman, <i>Time</i></b><br><br>Myfanwy Thomas awakens in a London park surrounded by dead bodies.

I know it looks like a conflict of interest, or favoritism, or nepotism, or some -ism or another that appears to be unethical. But it's not. Honestly.<p> Since I've been creating "Penzler's Picks" for Amazon.com I've never reviewed any of the books I've published under my imprint at Carroll &amp; Graf--until now. I've been tempted many times, for the obvious reason that, if I like a book enough to publish it, I'd like it well enough to recommend it. But I've resisted for the reason noted above.</p><p> My affection for and admiration of <i>Beasts</i>, however, is so enormous that I just can't help myself. I've been an admirer of Joyce Carol Oates for longer than I care to admit. Indeed, I raved about <i>Blonde</i> in these pages long before it was nominated for a National Book Award (and should have won, in my opinion).</p><p> <i>Beasts</i> is a little jewel of a book, only 138 pages. Hemingway's <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> is a perfect gem, and so are Steinbeck's <i>The Red Pony</i>, and James Ellroy's <i>Dick Contino's Blues</i>, and Henry James's <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>; the short novel is capable of being one of an author's masterpieces. Short novels, or novellas, allow for the author to develop characters more fully than is possible in a short story, yet constrict them enough to maintain a single mood, or tone, throughout the entire book, which might easily become oppressive in a longer work.</p><p> Set in an apparently idyllic New England college town, <i>Beasts</i> is the story of Gillian Brauer, a student who falls in love with her professor, his Bohemian lifestyle, and anti-establishment attitudes, and what happens when she falls under his spell.</p><p> Knowing that other girls preceded her does not deter Gillian from becoming part of the household of Professor Harrow and his larger-than-life wife, Dorcas, the outrageous sculptress of shocking wooden totems. Drawn into their life, Gillian soon becomes a helpless pawn, a victim of her own passions and those of her mentors. Or does she? Sometimes even the most seemingly powerless prey can surprise a predator.</p><p> Savor every word of this little masterpiece, as it is unlikely that you will read anything to equal it for a long, long time. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Joyce Carol Oates, one of America&#39;s most honoured writers, is the author of the New York Times bestseller and Oprah Book Club selection WE WERE THE MULVANEYS, such critically praised novels as BLONDE, BROKE HEART BLUES, BLACK WATER, and MIDDLE AGE.

He is considered by many to be the Mark Twain and James Thurber of his day. For many thousands of fans, for decades, &#x201c;Shep&#x201d; talked on the radio late at night, keeping them up way past their bedtimes. He entertained without a script, improvising like a jazz musician, on any and every subject you can imagine. He invented and remains the master of talk radio.<br><br>Shepherd perpetrated one of the great literary hoaxes of all time, promoting a nonexistent book and author, and then brought the book into existence. He wrote 23 short stories for <i>Playboy</i>, four times winning their humor of the year award, and also interviewed The Beatles for the magazine. He authored several popular books of humor and satire, created several television series and acted in several plays. He is the model for the character played by Jason Robards in the play and movie <i>A Thousand Clowns</i>, as well as the inspiration for the Shel Silverstein song made famous by Johnny Cash, &#x201c;A Boy Named Sue.&#x201d;<br><br>Readers will learn the significance of innumerable Shepherd words and phrases, such as &#x201c;Excelsior, you fathead &#x201d; and observe his constant confrontations with the America he loved. They will get to know and understand this multitalented genius by peeking behind the wall he built for himself &#x2013; a wall to hide a different and less agreeable persona. Through interviews with his friends, co-workers and creative associates, such as musician David Amram, cartoonist and playwright Jules Feiffer, publisher and broadcaster Paul Krassner, and author Norman Mailer, the book explains a complex and unique genius of our time.<br><br>&#x201c;Shepherd pretty much invented talk radio ... What I got of him was a wonder at the world one man could create. I am as awed now by his achievement as I was then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2013; Richard Corliss, <i>Time</i> magazine online</p><p>Eugene B. Bergmann began listening to Jean Shepherd radio shows in 1956. Besides studying hundreds of broadcast tapes, he read and viewed virtually all of Shepherd&#39;s extensive work in other media. He designs and makes artists books; for 34 years he designed exhibits for New York City&#39;s American Museum of Natural History.Although the prolific, multitalented Shepherd (1921-1999) was an actor, author, emcee, recording artist and screenwriter (<i>A Christmas Story</i>), he's remembered by many as a late-night radio raconteur , who for 21 years on New York City's WOR-AM mixed heartland humor and hip, sardonic rants with memories of his Indiana youth. This prismatic portrait affirms Shepherd's position as one of the 20th century's great humorists. Railing against conformity, he forged a unique personal bond with his loyal listeners, who participated in his legendary literary prank by asking bookstores for the nonexistent novel <i>I, Libertine</i> (when Ian Ballantine had Shepherd and Theodore Sturgeon make the fake real, <i>PW</i> called it "the hoax that became a book"). Storyteller Shepherd's grand theme was life itself; Marshall McLuhan called Shepherd's broadcasts "a new kind of novel that he writes nightly." Minus guests and call-ins, it was talk radio, but Shepherd was the only voice, ad-libbing monologues like jazz riffs for a huge following via WOR's 50,000-watt reach. Novelist Bergmann (<i>Rio Amazonas</i>) interviewed 32 people who knew Shepherd or were influenced by him and listened to hundreds of broadcast tapes, inserting transcripts of Shepherd's own words into a "biographical framework" of exhaustive research. 30 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They just didn&#x2019;t catch whoever pinned him to a barn wall with sixteen-penny nails.<br><br>Decades later, Megan, now a world-famous photojournalist, has come back to the bayou, looking for cop Dave Robicheaux. It was Dave who found the body of labor leader Jack Flynn. The sight changed the boy, shaped him as a man. And after forty years, Robicheaux is still haunted by the bizarre unsolved slaying.<br><br>Now Megan&#x2019;s return has stirred up the ghosts of the long-buried past, igniting a storm of violence that will rip apart lives of blacks and whites in this bayou country. And for a good cop with bad memories, hard desire, and chilling nightmares, the time has come to uncover the truth.</p><p>Imagine Philip Marlowe sans the cigarettes and in AA. Put him in Louisiana and jump forward 50 years or so and you've got David Robicheaux, a tough-talking detective with the same soft spot as his prototype for troublesome women and for delving into places into which he probably has no business. New Iberia, Louisiana, perfectly rivals Marlowe's L.A. for its grit and corruption and dames who'll turn a good guy bad. <p> James Lee Burke's 11th Robicheaux book, <i>Sunset Limited</i>, is a twisted mystery that at times becomes almost byzantine in its attempt to keep disparate characters and narratives wound in a cohesive story line. But Burke's writing is so stunning that all is forgiven as you become immersed in the tale, which meshes past and present to uncover the secret of a decades-old murder. </p><p> Forty years ago, a local labor leader was crucified in a crime that remains unsolved. Now, his daughter--Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Megan Flynn--returns to New Iberia. With a seemingly insignificant remark to Robicheaux, she begins a chain of events that lead right back to her father's death. New Iberia, in some sense, is frozen in time as the age-old problems of race and class weave their way into the mystery, complicating Robicheaux's discovery of not only the original crime, but the wealth of murders that spring up along the way. Add in the Chinese mob, corrupt policemen, and a Hollywood film shoot, and the stage is set. </p><p> Burke's forte is his ability to create characters so evil they're liable to get you up in the night to check in your closet and under your bed. The players--both good and bad--are characterized more by their flaws than their attributes, giving everyone a wicked sheen. The book isn't overly gory (although short descriptions can be rather graphic), but <i>everyone</i> has a dark side, emphasizing the <i>noir</i>-ish tones of the novel. His writing is powerful, mixing tender landscapes ("[W]e dropped through clouds that were pooled with fire in the sunrise and came in over biscuit-colored hills dotted with juniper and pine and pinyon trees...") with dead-on, cutting descriptions ("His face was tentacled with a huge purple-and-strawberry birthmark, so that his eyes looked squeezed inside a mask") and the camp dialogue of Chandler ("Evil doesn't have a zip code"). Oddly, these sundry elements blend seamlessly, allowing you to overlook tenuous connections and occasionally confusing turns. </p><p> Don't pick this up expecting a happy ending. But for those who long for a modern-day Chandler, you'll find <i>Sunset Limited</i> a gripping and satisfying read. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p>Critical acclaim for James Lee Burke:<p>"If you haven't already discovered Burke's novels, find one."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"Burke is a brilliant descriptive writer, perhaps the best in modern American fiction."<br><i>--Portland Oregonian</i></p><p>"Terrific reading.

But before he became a worldwide sensation, Scott Turow wrote a book that is entirely true, the account of his own searing indoctrination into the field of law called ... The first year of law school is an intellectual and emotional ordeal so grueling that it ensures only the fittest survive. Now Scott Turow takes you inside the oldest and most prestigious law school in the country when he becomes a &#34;One L,&#34; as entering students are known at Harvard Law School. In a book that became a national bestseller, a law school primer, and a classic autobiography, he brings to life the fascinating, shocking reality of that first year. Provocative and riveting, One L reveals the experience directly from the combat zone: the humiliations, triumphs, hazings, betrayals, and challenges that will make him a lawyer-and forever change Turow&#39;s mind, test his principles, and expose his heart.</p><p>Scott Turow is a writer and attorney. He is the author of seven best-selling novels: <em>Presumed Innocent</em> (1987), <em>The Burden of Proof</em> (1990), <em>Pleading Guilty</em> (1993), <em>The Laws of Our Fathers</em> (1996), <em>Personal Injuries</em> (1999), <em>Reversible Errors</em> (2002) and <em>Ordinary Heroes</em> (2005). A novella, <em>Limitations</em>, was published as a paperback original in November 2006 by Picador following its serialization in <em>The New York Times</em> Magazine. His works of non-fiction include <em>One L</em> (1977) about his experience as a law student, and <em>Ultimate Punishment</em> (2003), a reflection on the death penalty. He frequently contributes essays and op-ed pieces to publications such as <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Playboy</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>. Mr. Turow's books have won a number of literary awards, including the Heartland Prize in 2003 for <em>Reversible Errors</em> and the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award in 2004 for <em>Ultimate Punishment</em> and <em>Time Magazine</em>'s Best Work of Fiction, 1999 for <em>Personal Injuries</em>. His books have been translated into more than 25 languages, sold more than 25 million copies world-wide and have been adapted into one full length film and two television miniseries.Before the general public discovered Scott Turow's novels, law students knew him for One L. Published while he was still attending Harvard Law School, it tells the story of his first year (with names changed to protect privacy). Holter Graham reads the memoir with a youthful voice that captures all the wonder, surprise, and indignation that the na�ve Turow experienced in 1975-76. Turow's writing reveals self-deprecating humor, for example, his comment that a prof's brief "resembled the brief I had written only in that it was written on paper." We hear Turow's older, more jaded, and perhaps wiser voice as he introduces the 1977 book and closes it with comments and an interview.

One lay next to her head, near its crown, where her hair had become matted with blood the color and texture of crushed cherries. The other was gone. A clock ticked out the time in rhythmic staccatos, filling the house with bored urgency. In the kitchen, an egg timer went off, calling for her with its certain and persistent buzz.<br> <br>She was not a young woman. The skin on her face was loose, the folds around her eye deep. Her eye itself was brown and open and staring, it seemed, at the hemline of her living room curtains. The other eye had taken the blow that killed her, and was no longer intact. Its vitreous humor oozed onto the floor, pooling with blood and broken tissue; the eye itself&#x2014;the yellowed sclera, detached retina, puffy iris, and perfect lens&#x2014;was now lodged in the cavity behind her nose.<br> <br>The house was not particularly bright. The curtains were drawn and the furniture dark, the appliances brown. Pictures in equally dark frames lined the walls and covered tabletops and shelves. Her favorite, the one from her wedding, had overturned during the struggle and fallen to the floor. So her husband, handsome in his military blues, had not seen her get struck with the heavy cast iron kettle he&#x2019;d given her for their sixth wedding anniversary. But the others could see her just fine. Her sisters and brothers, children and grandchildren, parents and friends, could all see her now&#x2014;her mouth agape, her blood staining the cold terrazzo floor.<br> <br>An hour after the egg timer began to buzz, the oven started to smoke. Smoke streamed from the oven and drifted from room to room, touring the three-bedroom ranch the way a guest might. The smoke found the house&#x2019;s corners, its closets, its secret places, but did not trigger any of its five smoke detectors, which watched the smoke without warning of its arrival. When the house was nearly black with it, smoke exited slowly through the cracked mechanics of the house&#x2019;s old, jalousie-style windows. It poured from the house in thin, steady streams, appearing to lift it from its foundation, as if on strings.<br> <br>Then, it began to rain.<br> <br>The rain was soft at first&#x2014;tapping politely on the flat white roofs; dribbling down blades of grass; collecting in droplets on large, saucer-like leaves. Then, the rain began to drive, battering the large, bushy fronds of cabbage palms, disturbing delicate bougainvillea blossoms, and hammering the ground, causing mud to rise among perfect blades of St. Augustine grass, creating puddles where the driveways met the streets of Seven Springs, Florida. A ribbon of lightning split the sky, its thunderous sound causing the geckos, anoles, and skinks, which had been jumping to and fro in the soft rain, to scurry beneath shrubbery, into drain spouts, under doorways, and into houses.<br> <br>The rain grew harder, denser, louder. It pounded against windows, drummed against streets, flooded garages. Curtains of it rained down on the golf courses, swimming pools, and highways in and around Seven Springs, causing whiteout conditions and minor traffic accidents. Another thread of lightning shocked the dark gray sky, causing a boom so loud it rattled the windows of houses and tripped the alarm sensors on a half dozen parked cars. Still, smoke poured through the broken seals of the little yellow house where the old woman had lived and died, darker now.<br> <br>Several blocks away, a man stood in his backyard with a shovel, sweating, though the rain had made it cool. He began to dig a hole.</p><h2>Patterns of Home: The Ten Essentials of Enduring Design</h2><p>The key to creating a house that is memorable, satisfying, and enduring is to apply a group of design concepts--or "patterns"--that focus on the experience of being in a home. In this groundbreaking work, internationally respected architects Max Jacobson, Murray Silverstein, and Barbara Winslow present the ten essential patterns that shape and define a well-crafted home. Patterns explore the presence of light, the relationship between indoors and out, the flow through rooms, and the feel of one space as you are sitting in another.<br> Clearly written and profusely illustrated with houses from all over the country, "Patterns of Home," brings the timeless lessons of residential design to anyone seeking inspiration and direction in the design or remodel of a home. The patterns described in the book can make the difference between a home that satisfies only the material needs of the owners and one that captures the essence of home.</p><p><p></p> <p>Max Jacobson, founding partner in the internationally respected California firm JSWD Architects, has been practicing architecture for almost 40 years. Co-author of <i>A Pattern Language</i> and <i>Patterns of Home </i>(the latter<i> </i>published by The Taunton Press), Max has been a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley and is currently Instructor of Architecture at Diablo Valley College in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Coauthors (along with several other writers) of the landmark design guide A Pattern Language, Jacobson and Silverstein join with their architectural partner, Winslow, to further simplify building design by distilling the principles they previously set forth as ten essentials for residential homes. These fundamentals cover such subjects as making the best use of light; keeping all parts of the house from windows to walls to rooms in proportion; and including "in-between" places like porches, window seats, alcoves and sunrooms in the design of the home. Some of their concepts are fairly abstract; for example, they suggest imagining the home as not just a building but a "site" that contains both indoor and outdoor rooms, and they counsel readers to "let the overall form of the house grow naturally out of the forms of its various parts, rather than being superimposed from the outside." These theories are complemented by more concrete advice about how to measure out a human-sized room, balance private and common spaces and much more. The authors include diagrams and color photographs of 33 actual homes with detailed explanatory captions. While it is aimed predominately at professional designers, this guide is useful for anyone contemplating a new home or making renovations to an existing one; certainly it will change the way readers think about the architectural spaces around them.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Short Straw (Ed Eagle Novel)</h2><p>Having married the seductive Barbara Kennedy against his better judgment, Santa Fe lawyer Ed Eagle awakens the morning after his fortieth birthday to discover that his wife has vanished and that all of his money has been wired to Mexico, a circumstance that is complicated by a new case involving a part-time mechanic who has been charged with a triple homicide. By the author of Santa Fe Rules. 225,000 first printing.</p><p>Stuart Woods is the author of fifty novels, including the New York Timesbestselling Stone Barrington and Holly Barker series.

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in New York City, Florida, and Maine.<b>One</b><p>ED EAGLE DIDN&#x2019;T WANT TO GET OUT OF BED. USUALLY HE woke at the stroke of seven, put his feet on the floor and was up and running, but not this morning. He drifted for a moment, then snapped back. He raised his head and looked at the large digital clock that rested on top of the huge, flat-screen TV on his bedroom wall: 10:03A.M. Impossible. Clock broken.</p><p>He sat up and checked his wristwatch on the bedside table: 10:03. What the hell was going on? He had a hundred people coming to lunch at the grand opening of his new offices at noon, and there was much to do. Why hadn&#x2019;t Barbara woken him? He stood up. &#x201c;Barbara?&#x201d; he yelled. Silence. He looked at the other side of the bed: still made up.</p><p>He staggered into the bathroom and splashed water on his face, then he walked across the hall to his wife&#x2019;s bathroom. Not there. On the marble shelf under the mirror was a small plastic bottle from the pharmacy, lid off. He picked it up and read the label. AMBIEN. Sleeping pill. He never took them. He looked inside: empty.</p><p>He replayed the evening before: steaks for the two of them, grilled on the big Viking range, Caesar salad, bourbon before, bottle of red with. Half a bottle of red wine would not cause him to over-sleep. Not unless it contained an Ambien or two. He had an uncomfortable feeling in his gut.</p><p>He walked downstairs in his bare feet and checked every room, then he went to the garage. Barbara&#x2019;s Range Rover was gone. Could she have gone to the office without him to get ready for the gathering, letting him sleep late? She must have.</p><p>Ed went back upstairs, shaved and stood in a shower until he felt human again, then he blew dry his longish black hair, dressed in a new shirt, recently arrived from his shirtmaker in London, then a new suit, recently arrived from his tailor in the same city. He pulled on a pair of black alligator western boots, which added a couple of inches to his six-feet, seven-inch height&#x2014;or altitude, as he liked to think of it&#x2014;chose a tie and a silk pocket square, grabbed his Stetson and headed for town.</p><p>He parked in his reserved space in the basement garage of the newly constructed, five-story office building, just off Santa Fe&#x2019;s Plaza, then took the private elevator to the penthouse. His new offices were swarming with people: painters touching up here and there, janitors cleaning up after the painters, secretaries, caterers, people hanging pictures. Most of these things should have been done by the day before, but everything always ran a little late. He grabbed a passing secretary.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Barbara?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; the woman replied, then continued on her way.</p><p>He walked across the open flagstone area just inside the glass doors and into his new office, tossing his Stetson onto a bentwood hat rack. A painter was daubing at a place on the wall next to the windows. He picked up the phone and pressed the Page button.</p><p>&#x201c;Barbara?&#x201d; he said, hearing his voice echo across the whole floor.</p><p>His secretary picked up the phone. &#x201c;Ed? Barbara&#x2019;s not here yet. I thought she would come with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She left the house before I did, Betty, and I overslept.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you slept at all,&#x201d; she replied drily.</p><p>&#x201c;Not after seven A.M., I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tie one on last night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I tied on two ounces of bourbon and half a bottle of wine, and that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll turn up,&#x201d; Betty said. &#x201c;Excuse me, I&#x2019;ve got things to do.&#x201d; She hung up.</p><p>Ed opened the French doors and walked out onto his newly planted, private terrace. He strolled over to the parapet and viewed the action in the plaza. Everything was as usual: the Indians selling their jewelry on the sidewalk in front of the Governor&#x2019;s Palace, old folks taking the spring sun on the benches in the little park, shopkeepers sweeping their sidewalks. Santa Fe had been up for hours, but, like him, it was just waking. Ed went back inside and walked slowly around the offices, inspecting everything carefully. It was all finally coming together. He walked out onto the larger terrace. The caterers had set up a bar and a long lunch table, and they were hand-trucking in dishes, silverware and serving pieces.</p><p>He went back to his office and sat down, not knowing what to do next. He was still fuzzy around the edges. Coffee, that&#x2019;s what. He walked over to the built-in cabinets on one wall of his office and opened a pair of doors, revealing a little kitchenette. Betty had already made the coffee, and he poured himself a mug and took a Danish from the plate she had left there. Special occasion. He went back to his desk and stood by it, sipping his coffee.</p><p>It was his fiftieth birthday. Moreover, with the opening of his new offices, this day was the culmination of everything he had worked for over the past twenty-five years. He had long been Santa Fe&#x2019;s top trial attorney, but he had finally and firmly established himself as one of the half-dozen best trial lawyers west of the Mississippi, and that included Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. When people were accused of bad things, they thought of Ed Eagle.</p><p>One case had done more than any other to help him achieve that status: the Wolf Willett murders, a couple of years earlier. Wolf was a Hollywood producer, and three people had been murdered in his Santa Fe home: himself and his wife, Julia, among them, or so it had first seemed. Wolf had been astonished to learn of his own death when he had read about it, and he had come to Ed Eagle for help. Ed&#x2019;s clearing of Wolf Willett had made headlines all over the country and had revealed the sordid background of Julia Willett. Ed was now married to Julia&#x2019;s sister, and he believed he knew everything about her background.</p><p>And where the hell was she? It was past eleven o&#x2019;clock, and their guests were due at noon.</p><p>Betty came into his office with a sheet of paper in her hand, closed the door behind her and leaned against it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to want to sit down,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds ominous,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;It was meant to. Sit down.&#x201d;</p><p>Ed obediently sat down.</p><p>Betty took a deep breath, walked over to his desk and laid the sheet of paper on it. &#x201c;I just found this in the fax machine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t see it sooner, but I&#x2019;ve been busy.&#x201d;</p><p>Ed picked up the sheet of paper, which was a letter from his bank. He read aloud: &#x201c;This is to confirm the wire transfer of $930,000 from your firm account and $170,000 from your personal account to...&#x201d; He stopped reading aloud. &#x201c;To an account in the Cayman Islands? What the hell is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds very much like all the cash you have,&#x201d; Betty said. &#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;ve got something in your sock.&#x201d;</p><p>Ed bared his teeth. &#x201c;Look in my mouth,&#x201d; he said to Betty. &#x201c;Do I still have my eyeteeth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Figuratively speaking,&#x201d; Betty replied, &#x201c;no.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Two</b></p><p>EAGLE SET THE LETTER DOWN ON HIS DESK. HIS MIND, which had been slowed by the remnants of the sleeping pill, was suddenly operating under full steam. &#x201c;Get me my broker,&#x201d; he said to Betty.</p><p>Betty picked up the phone on his desk, dialed the number and handed him the phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Jim?&#x201d; Eagle said.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Ed. I expect you&#x2019;re calling about the wire transfer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I am. Has it gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been handed the authorization. We liquidated your accounts yesterday, as per your fax. The wire will be gone in five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hold everything,&#x201d; Eagle said.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do not wire those funds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right; what do you want me to do with all this cash? It&#x2019;s just over four million dollars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it too late to cancel the sale of all those stocks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes; it was done yesterday. I know you wanted the funds wired before two P.M., but we couldn&#x2019;t release that large a sum until we had confirmations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jim, listen to me very carefully: the fax you got was not sent by me and did not reflect my wishes. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was signed by Barbara, Ed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to send you a letter confirming that the instructions were unauthorized, and I want you to call someone at the IRS immediately and inform them of that fact. Follow up with a letter, because otherwise, I&#x2019;ll be faced with a hell of a tax bill for the capital gains on those sales.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, I will, Ed, and I want to apologize, but I thought....&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, Jim; we caught it in time, and I&#x2019;m not going to hold your firm responsible for anything but the notification of the IRS. I&#x2019;ll talk to you later. Oh, by the way, send me the paperwork immediately for removing Barbara&#x2019;s name from all my accounts.&#x201d;</p><p>Eagle hung up and turned to Betty. &#x201c;Call the credit card companies and cancel all Barbara&#x2019;s credit cards, with immediate effect. I&#x2019;ll talk to them, if necessary. Also, have them fax copies of all the charges in the last and current billing cycle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; Betty said and left the office.</p><p>Eagle got up and went into the shiny new bathroom off his shiny new office and vomited what was left of last night&#x2019;s dinner into the shiny new toilet. He drank a glass of water, then went back to his desk and called Russell Norris. Norris was a retired top IRS agent who now worked as a consultant. He was very good at dealing with foreign banks. He explained the situation to Norris, who promised to get back to him quickly.</p><p>Eagle took a deep breath and called the president of his bank. &#x201c;Fred?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Ed. I was just about to leave for your shindig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. Before you do, I received a fax from you this morning, addressed to Barbara, confirming a transaction. I expect you are familiar with that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, Ed, I handled it myself, yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me carefully, Fred: I did not authorize the transaction; the instructions are fraudulent.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a silence at the other end of the phone, and when the man spoke again, his voice was shaky. &#x201c;Ed, tell me this is a joke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is not a joke. The instructions were not mine, and the signature on the fax is not mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I tried to call you to confirm it, but neither your old office or your new one answered. All I got was a message saying you were closed for moving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fred, you need to report this to your board immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I want those funds back in my account before the close of business today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ed, I don&#x2019;t know about that; I&#x2019;ll have to talk to my board. Why did Barbara do this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet; I&#x2019;m just beginning my investigation. I will follow up with written notification of the fraud, and I will expect you and your board to do the right thing. Come to think of it, you can hold your board meeting right here, since all the members are coming to our opening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I suppose we could, Ed. I&#x2019;ll talk to you later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good-bye, Fred.&#x201d;</p><p>Betty came into the office with several sheets of paper. &#x201c;Looks like Barbara has been shopping for a lot of new clothes,&#x201d; she said, laying them on the desk. &#x201c;About thirty thousand dollars&#x2019; worth, and some new luggage, too. Oh, and there&#x2019;s a little item on her American Express card for twenty-two thousand dollars for the charter of a jet from a company in Albuquerque. I called them: they picked up a Mrs. Eagle at seven A.M. this morning at the Santa Fe airport and flew her to Mexico City. She landed an hour ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good God,&#x201d; Eagle said.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no extradition from Mexico, is there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even for murder,&#x201d; Eagle replied.</p><p>&#x201c;How much did she get away with?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One million, one hundred thousand dollars,&#x201d; Eagle replied. &#x201c;Of the bank&#x2019;s money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The bank&#x2019;s money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my story and I&#x2019;m sticking to it,&#x201d; Eagle said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds good to me,&#x201d; Betty said. &#x201c;Now, you&#x2019;d better get on your feet and slap a smile on your face, because the governor just arrived, and the place is filling up fast.&#x201d;</p><p>Ed stood up. &#x201c;When the party&#x2019;s over, send somebody out to the airport to pick up Barbara&#x2019;s Range Rover.&#x201d; He unclipped the key from his ring and handed it to her. &#x201c;Can you think of anything else I should do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Call the FBI.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remind me when all these people have gone.&#x201d; He straightened his tie and, trying not to look pale, walked out of his office and onto the terrace, where his guests were gathering.</p><p><b>Three</b></p><p>EAGLE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND RECEIVED him warmly. Since Eagle had been a steady contributor to the man&#x2019;s campaigns&#x2019; first for congress, then for governor, the warmth was returned.</p><p>When that duty had been accomplished, he worked the crowd, shaking every hand, accepting compliments on his new quarters, charming everyone wherever he went. The crowd drank, ate, then thinned, and after he had pumped the last hand, he returned to his office, where the bank president and the chairman of his board awaited on his sofa.</p><p>&#x201c;Fred, Arthur,&#x201d; he said, sitting down opposite them.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come right to the point, Ed,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;Arthur and I have canvassed every member of the board, we&#x2019;ve talked to our attorneys, and we&#x2019;ve consulted the state banking board. It&#x2019;s like this: Barbara was a signator on both accounts, though not an owner of the accounts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that, Fred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Therefore, the bank is not liable for her actions. We received a lawful instruction from her, and we complied. Barbara has stolen not from the bank, but from you. You&#x2019;re a lawyer; you should know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had forgotten Barbara was a signator on the firm account,&#x201d; Eagle said. &#x201c;A year and a half ago, she reorganized our billing and payables, and we put her signature on the account at that time. We never removed it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry we can&#x2019;t be of more help,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;I know this puts you in a temporary bind. We can do a short-term loan to help your cash flow situation. How&#x2019;s half a million?&#x201d;</p><p>Eagle did some quick calculations. He had to finish paying for the work on the offices, nearly half a million; the party had cost fifty grand, and he had other payables, too. Also, he had to repurchase stocks to avoid taxes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need a million and a half, Fred,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Fred and Arthur exchanged a glance. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s above my lending limit, Ed; Arthur&#x2019;s, too. We&#x2019;ll have to go to committee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We meet every Wednesday. I can do the half-million immediately, if that helps.&#x201d;</p><p>Eagle nodded. He hated borrowing money. &#x201c;Send me the note this afternoon.&#x201d; He stood up. &#x201c;Thanks for your help, Fred, Arthur. I needn&#x2019;t tell you this has to be kept highly confidential, even from your board, if that&#x2019;s possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They already know, Ed, from our discussions earlier today. I&#x2019;ll impress upon each of them the necessity of confidentiality.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get to tell you earlier,&#x201d; Fred said, &#x201c;but the offices are magnificent, a credit to the community.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Fred.&#x201d; They shook hands and left.</p><p>Betty came in as soon as they were gone. &#x201c;Russell Norris is on the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>Eagle picked it up and pressed the button. &#x201c;Russell?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ed, I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;re too late. If we&#x2019;d known yesterday, I might have been able to intercept the funds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She bounced the money to Mexico City, just like her sister did a couple of years ago. It went to the Banco Internacional this morning; I might be able to do something there, depending on how fast she moves.

While Rahlfs' text is available in electronic form. . . there is still no substitute for having a good and updated critical apparatus as well.

My transporter was cheap, so even a droplet of moisture, or more likely, a grain of sand, would cause it to short. It was faulty and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked.<br> Please not now, please not now, I thought.<br> The transporter shivered in the sand and I held my breath.<br> Tiny, flat, and black as a prayer stone, it buzzed softly and then slowly rose from the sand. Finally, it produced the baggage-lifting force. I grinned. Now I could make it to the shuttle. I swiped otjize from my forehead with my index finger and knelt down. Then I touched the finger to the sand, grounding the sweet smelling red clay into it. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> It was a half-mile walk along the dark desert road. With the transporter working, I would make it there on time.<br> Straightening up, I paused and shut my eyes. Now the weight of my entire life was pressing on my shoulders. I was defying the most traditional part of myself for the first time in my entire life.<br> I was leaving in the dead of night and they had no clue. My nine siblings, all older than me except for my younger sister and brother, would never see this coming. My parents would never imagine I&#x2019;d do such a thing in a million years. By the time they all realized what I&#x2019;d done and where I was going, I&#x2019;d have left the planet. In my absence, my parents would growl to each other that I was to never set foot in their home again. My four aunties and two uncles who lived down the road would shout and gossip among themselves about how I&#x2019;d scandalized our entire bloodline. I was going to be a pariah.<br> &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; I softly whispered to the transporter, stamping my foot. The thin metal rings I wore around each ankle jingled noisily, but I stamped my foot again. Once on, the transporter worked best when I didn&#x2019;t touch it. &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; I said again, sweat forming on my brow. When nothing moved, I chanced giving the two large suitcases sitting atop the force field a shove. They moved smoothly and I breathed another sigh of relief. At least some luck was on my side.<br> Fifteen minutes later I purchased a ticket and boarded the shuttle. The sun was barely beginning to peak over the horizon. As I moved past seated passengers far too aware of the bushy ends of my plaited hair softly slapping people in the face, I cast my eyes to the floor. Our hair is thick and mine has always been very thick. My old auntie liked to call it &#x201c;ododo&#x201d; because it grew wild and dense like ododo grass. Just before leaving, I&#x2019;d rolled my plaited hair with fresh sweet- smelling otjize I&#x2019;d made specifically for this trip. Who knew what I looked like to these people who didn&#x2019;t know my people so well.<br> A woman leaned away from me as I passed, her face pinched as if she smelled something foul. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I whispered, watching my feet and trying to ignore the stares of almost everyone in the shuttle. Still, I couldn&#x2019;t help glancing around. Two girls who might have been a few years older than me, covered their mouths with hands so pale that they looked untouched by the sun. Everyone looked as if the sun was his or her enemy. I was the only Himba on the shuttle. I quickly found and moved to a seat.<br> The shuttle was one of the new sleek models that looked like the bullets my teachers used to calculate ballistic coefficients during my A-levels when I was growing up. These ones glided fast over land using a combination of air current, magnetic fields, and exponential energy&#x2014; an easy craft to build if you had the equipment and the time. It was also a nice vehicle for hot desert terrain where the roads leading out of town were terribly maintained. My people didn&#x2019;t like to leave the homeland. I sat in the back so I could look out the large window.<br> I could see the lights from my father&#x2019;s astrolabe shop and the sand storm analyzer my brother had built at the top of the Root&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what we called my parents&#x2019; big, big house. Six generations of my family had lived there. It was the oldest house in my village, maybe the oldest in the city. It was made of stone and concrete, cool in the night, hot in the day. And it was patched with solar planes and covered with bioluminescent plants that liked to stop glowing just before sunrise. My bedroom was at the top of the house. The shuttle began to move and I stared until I couldn&#x2019;t see it anymore. &#x201c;What am I doing?&#x201d; I whispered.<br> An hour and a half later, the shuttle arrived at the launch port. I was the last off, which was good because the sight of the launch port overwhelmed me so much that all I could do for several moments was stand there. I was wearing a long red skirt, one that was silky like water, a light orange wind- top that was stiff and durable, thin leather sandals, and my anklets. No one around me wore such an outfit. All I saw were light flowing garments and veils; not one woman&#x2019;s ankles were exposed, let alone jingling with steel anklets. I breathed through my mouth and felt my face grow hot.<br> &#x201c;Stupid stupid stupid,&#x201d; I whispered. We Himba don&#x2019;t travel. We stay put. Our ancestral land is life; move away from it and you diminish. We even cover our bodies with it. Otjize is red land. Here in the launch port, most were Khoush and a few other non-Himba. Here, I was an outsider; I was outside. &#x201c;What was I thinking?&#x201d; I whispered.<br> I was sixteen years old and had never been beyond my city, let alone near a launch station. I was by myself and I had just left my family. My prospects of marriage had been 100 percent and now they would be zero. No man wanted a woman who&#x2019;d run away. However, beyond my prospects of normal life being ruined, I had scored so high on the planetary exams in mathematics that the Oomza University had not only admitted me, but promised to pay for whatever I needed in order to attend. No matter what choice I made, I was never going to have a normal life, really.<br> I looked around and immediately knew what to do next. I walked to the help desk.</p><h2>The Way of Chinese Painting : Its Ideas and Technique - With Selections from the Seventeenth Century Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting</h2><p>With selections from the seventeenth century mustard seed garden manual painting</p><p></p><h2>The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)</h2><p>Four courageous people--Dion, a young man seeking his destiny; Tusk, the mercenary; outlaw commander Dixter; and the beautiful and cunning Lady Maigrey--battle the corrupt and harsh Democratic Commonwealth</p><p>By calling a temporary truce, Derek Sagan and the rebels thwarted the alien Corasian invasion.

Driven by unfathomably wealthy and powerful businessmen like J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, armies of workers, both male and female, were harnessed to a new vision of massive industry. A society rooted in the soil became one based in cities, and legions of immigrants were drawn to American shores. What&#x2019;s more, in accomplishing its revolution, capitalism threatened to eclipse American democracy. &#x201c;What do I care about the law?&#x201d; bellowed Cornelius Vanderbilt. &#x201c;Hain&#x2019;t I got the power?&#x201d; He did, and with it he and the other capitalists reshaped every aspect of American life. In <i>American Colossus, </i>H.W. Brands portrays the emergence, in a remarkably short time, of a recognizably modern America. <br><br>The capitalist revolution left not a single area or aspect of American life untouched. It roared across the South, wrenching that region from its feudal past and integrating the southern economy into the national one. It burst over the West, dictating the destruction of Native American economies and peoples, driving the exploitation of natural resources, and making the frontier of settlement a business frontier as well. It crashed across the urban landscape of the East and North, turning cities into engines of wealth and poverty, opulence and squalor. It swamped the politics of an earlier era, capturing one major party and half of the other, inspiring the creation of a third party and determining the issues over which all three waged some of the bitterest battles in American history. <br><br>Brands&#x2019;s spellbinding narrative beautifully depicts the oil gushers of western Pennsylvania, the rise, in Chicago, of the first skyscraper, the exploration of the Colorado River, the cattle drives of the West, and the early passionate sparks of union life. By 1900 the America he portrays is wealthier than ever, yet prosperity is precarious, inequality rampant, and democracy stretched thin. <i>American Colossus</i> is an unforgettable portrait of the years when the contest between capitalism and democracy was at its sharpest, and capitalism triumphed.</p><p><b>H. W. Brands</b> is the Dickson Allen Anderson Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin.

He didn&#x2019;t fight, although he was prime military material, being in his midtwenties and blessed with solid health. Instead he hired a substitute in the manner of many rich, tepid Unionists. Morgan&#x2019;s father was a transatlantic banker with one foot in New York and the other in London; to train his son for the business he had sent him to school in Switzerland and college in Germany. The young man&#x2019;s aptitude for numbers prompted one of his professors at Gottingen to suggest a post on the mathematics faculty, but he replied that he heard the family business calling, and he returned to America to become a commodities trader. In an early transaction he bought a boatload of coffee without authorization; before his astonished superiors could fire him, he unloaded the cargo for a fat profit. They appreciated the income but distrusted the audacity and so declined to make him a partner, whereupon, in 1861, he planted his own flag on Wall Street.<br><br>His timing couldn&#x2019;t have been better, nor his scruples more suited to the opportunities the war afforded. Hearing of a man who had purchased five thousand old carbines from an armory in New York for $3.50 each, Morgan proceeded to finance a second purchaser, who paid $11.50 per gun, rifled the barrels to improve the weapons&#x2019; range and accuracy, and sold them back to the government for $22.00 apiece. The government got something for the six-fold premium it paid to repurchase its guns, but not nearly as much as Morgan did.<br><br>Morgan speculated in all manner of commodities during the war. Though he didn&#x2019;t shun honest risk, neither did he unnecessarily court it. He cultivated confidential informants who could tell him, a critical moment before such news became common knowledge, of the latest developments on the battlefield. His rewards were remarkable, especially for one so young. The tax return he filed in the spring of Appomattox revealed an annual income of more than $50,000, at a time when an unskilled worker counted himself lucky to get $200.<br><br>Morgan wasn&#x2019;t alone in profiting from the nation&#x2019;s distress. Andrew Carnegie had clerked on the Pennsylvania Railroad during the decade before the war; by the time the war ended he was crowing, "I&#x2019;m rich! I&#x2019;m rich," from his speculations in railroads, iron, and oil. John D. Rockefeller focused on oil and did even better than Carnegie, creating the company that would show America and the world what an industrial monopoly looked like and how it behaved. Jay Cooke sold more than a billion dollars of bonds for the Union and took several hundred thousand in commission for himself. Cornelius Vanderbilt lengthened his lead as the richest man in America by diversifying from steamboats into railroads. Jay Gould learned the ways of Wall Street and the weaknesses of the federal government as he prepared for a breathtaking assault on the nation&#x2019;s gold supply. Daniel Drew, Gould&#x2019;s occasional partner, summarized the mood of the entrepreneurial classes: "Along with ordinary happenings, we fellows in Wall Street had the fortunes of war to speculate about, and that always makes great doings on a stock exchange. It&#x2019;s good fishing in troubled waters."<br>&nbsp;<br>When Abraham Lincoln honored the heroes of Gettysburg after the battle that largely decided the war, he carried his listeners back to the dawn of American freedom, to the moment when Thomas Jefferson drafted and the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson&#x2019;s assertion that all men were created equal provided the basis for democracy--the government of, by, and for the people Lincoln proclaimed the Gettysburg dead had died defending.<br><br>Yet another manifesto of 1776 was beginning, by the time of the Civil War, to exert as much influence over American life. Adam Smith&#x2019;s <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was to capitalism what Jefferson&#x2019;s Declaration was to democracy; where Jefferson cited natural law to justify a politics of self-government, Smith appealed to human nature in support of an economics of self-interest. Democracy didn&#x2019;t spring fully formed from Jefferson&#x2019;s brow, nor capitalism from the brain of Smith; each required decades to evolve and mature. But nowhere did they mature more fully than in the United States, which became the world&#x2019;s archetype of a capitalist democracy.<br><br>Yet the dual manifestos of 1776 were also dueling manifestos. The visions limned by Jefferson and Smith were in some ways complementary, with each claiming to maximize personal freedom, the first in politics, the second in economics. But in other respects they were antagonistic. Democracy depends on equality, capitalism on inequality. Citizens in a democracy come to the public square with one vote each; participants in a capitalist economy arrive at the marketplace with unequal talents and resources and leave the marketplace with unequal rewards. Nor is inequality simply a side effect of capitalism. A capitalist economy can&#x2019;t operate without it. The differing talents and resources of individuals are recruited and sorted by the differential rewards, which reinforce the original differences. Inequality drives the engine of capitalism as surely as unequal temperatures drive heat engines--including the steam engines that were the signature devices of industrial capitalism.<br><br>Tension between capitalism and democracy has characterized American life for two centuries, with one and then the other claiming temporary ascendance. During the first half of the nineteenth century, democracy took the lead, as the states abandoned property qualifications for voting and the parties responded by courting the masses of ordinary men. Andrew Jackson embodied the democratic ethos, by both his humble origins and his reverence for the people as the wellspring of political legitimacy. Jackson waged political war on the pet projects of the big capitalists of his day, smashing the Bank of the United States, vetoing federal spending on roads and canals, and beating down tariff rates.<br><br>But capitalism fought back during the Civil War. Even as the Republican party freed the slaves, it emancipated the capitalist classes from the constraints imposed by Jackson and his Democratic heirs. Government became the sponsor of business rather than its foe, underwriting railroad construction, raising tariff rates, creating a national currency, and allowing the likes of Morgan to troll for fortunes in the troubled waters of the war.<br><br>And the war was just the beginning of the capitalist ascendance. Morgan&#x2019;s peace proved even better than his war. He never became as wealthy as Carnegie, Rockefeller, or some of the other great capitalists of the era; upon the reading in 1913 of Morgan&#x2019;s will, which showed an estate of $68 million (exclusive of an art collection valued at $50 million), Carnegie lamented, "And to think, he was not a rich man." Yet Morgan&#x2019;s power was more pervasive than the others&#x2019;. Carnegie dominated steel, the industry on which modern America was, almost literally, built, and Rockefeller controlled oil, which lit, lubricated, and was beginning to power American life. But Morgan commanded money, the philosopher&#x2019;s stone of modern capitalism. Morgan money&#x2019;s reorganized the railroads, the nation&#x2019;s vascular system. It bought out Carnegie and fought off Rockefeller to create the largest corporation in American history to that time, the United States Steel trust. And in one telling instance, it rescued President Grover Cleveland and the federal government from financial catastrophe.<br><br>In his lighter moments Morgan played at being a pirate. He cruised about in a black-painted yacht he called the <i>Corsair</i>; he read of the exploits of that other famous Morgan, the English buccaneer Henry, and wondered if they were related. But Morgan was more than a pirate. He was a revolutionary. Pirates prey on the status quo; Morgan dismantled and rebuilt it. During the decades after the Civil War, Morgan and his fellow capitalists effected a stunning transformation in American life. They turned a society rooted in the soil into one based in cities. They lifted the standard of living of ordinary people to a plane associated, not long before in America and for decades after elsewhere, with aristocracy. They drew legions of souls from foreign countries to American shores. They established the basis for the projection of American economic and military power to the farthest corners of the planet.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t do this alone, of course. A secret of their success was their ability to harness the strength and skill of armies of men and women to their capitalist purposes. More than a few of these foot soldiers participated unwillingly in the revolution; many hated Morgan and his ilk and passionately opposed them. But the nature of revolutions is to sweep the reluctant along, and despite the protests of farmers, laborers, and others attuned to a different time and sensibility, the capitalist revolution surged forward.<br><br>It left not a single area or aspect of American life untouched. It roared across the South, wrenching that region from its feudal past into the capitalist present, reshaping relations of race, property, and class and integrating the Southern economy into the national economy. It burst over the West, dictating the destruction of aboriginal economies and peoples, driving the exploitation of natural resources and making the frontier of settlement a frontier of national--and global--capitalist development. It crashed across the urban landscape of the East and North, turning cities into engines of wealth and poverty, opulence and squalor, that confirmed cardinal tenets of the American creed even as it contradicted others. It swamped the politics of an earlier era, capturing one major party and half the other, inspiring the creation of a third party, and determining the issues over which all three waged some of the bitterest battles in American...</p></p><h2>Navajo Weaving Way</h2><p><p>Noel Bennett met traditional Navajo weaver Tiana Bighorse in 1968. In time Tiana took her into her family as a daughter. Together they sheared sheep, collected plants, dyed wool, carded, spun, and wove. This book records their many experiences together, a collaboration that spans nearly thirty years. In 1971, Tiana and Noel wrote <i>Working with the Wool: How to Weave a Navajo Rug</i>. Noel later wrote <i>Designing with the Wool</i> and <i>The Weaver's Pathway</i>. Now, this single, authoritative volume brings together those three books--with updates and revisions--as well as excerpts from other published articles and books by Noel and Tiana about Navajo weaving, culture, and history. Detailed charts and illustrations help the weaver find her way step-by-step through the making of a first sampler and through several more advanced techniques.</p></p><p>Noel Bennett writes and paints at her experimental strawbale house in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico.The publisher has performed a real service in making available the work of Bennett, whose books on Navajo weaving and tradition have been out of print for some time. In 1968, as young woman, Bennett moved to the Navajo reservation in Arizona planning a two-year stay to learn traditional Navajo weaving and spinning techniques. She remained for eight years, learned to weave under the tutelage of Tiana Bighorse, and began a life-long fascination with the Navajo way of life. This volume is a reworking of Bennett's Working with the Wool (1971), The Weaver's Pathway (1974), and Designing with the Wool (1979), combining material from these earlier books with new information on Navajo spinning and dyeing techniques.

Now, in a book that can heal our harried lives, the author of the spiritual classic <b>How, Then, Shall We Live? </b> shows us how to create a special time of rest, delight, and renewal--a refuge for our souls.<br><br>Our relentless emphasis on success and productivity has become a form of violence, Muller says. We have lost the necessary rhythm of life, the balance between effort and rest, doing and not doing. Constantly striving, we feel exhausted and deprived in the midst of great abundance, longing for time with friends and family, longing for a moment to ourselves.<br><br>Millennia ago, the tradition of Sabbath created an oasis of sacred time within a life of unceasing labor. This consecrated time, Muller affirms, is available to all of us, regardless of our spiritual tradition. We need not even schedule an entire day each week. Sabbath time can be a sabbath afternoon, a sabbath hour, a sabbath walk. Sabbath time is time off the wheel, time when we take our hand from the plow and allow the essential goodness of creation to nourish our souls.<br><br>With wonderful stories, poems, and suggestions for practice, Muller teaches us how we can use this time of sacred rest to refresh our bodies and minds, restore our creativity, and regain our birthright of inner happiness. In <b>Sabbath</b>, he has given us a revolutionary tool for cultivating those necessary human qualities that grow only with time: wisdom, courage, honesty, generosity, healing, and love.</p><p>It's sad that we need a book to remind us of the importance of scheduling time to rest and worship. But because we can work, shop, achieve, and otherwise stay busy every hour of every day of the week, we do. The statement, "I am so busy" has become a frighteningly common lament, according to author Wayne Muller. Our perpetual state of busyness represents a war on our natural rhythms that demand quiet and renewal in order to be emotionally, spiritually, and creatively fertile. <p> Honoring the Sabbath need not be a commitment to a specific day of the week, explains Muller. In fact, it can be a yearlong retreat or a morning walk--"anything that preserves a visceral experience of life-giving nourishment and rest." </p><p> Far more than an interesting concept, this is a good read. Each chapter is provocative and fluid, with topics such as "Fear of Rest," "Dormancy," and "The Way of Enough." At the end of his chapters, Muller offers stories, poems, or practices that speak to the themes of the Sabbath. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"This is a book that may save your life. In a culture where few question that more is better, <i>Sabbath</i> offers a surprising direction for healing to anyone who has ever glimpsed emptiness at the heart of a busy and productive life."<br>--Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D., author of <i>Kitchen Table Wisdom</i><p>"This is a superb book--but more than superb, it is a necessary one.

She feigned interest in her reflection in the mirror, but in reality, she watched the housemaid behind her, packing away every last one of her belongings.</p><p>Early that morning, Sir John had come to her room and announced that they were leaving Bath that very day. He refused to tell her where they were going, fearful she would somehow get word to Anthony Fontaine. Nor was he allowing her to bring any of the servants, who would of course wish to know where they were headed, and might let slip their destination.</p><p>Marianna&#x2019;s stomach clenched. Did he really think another move would stop her? Stop <i>him</i>?</p><p>She shot to her feet and stalked to the window. Pulling back the gauzy drapery, she frowned.

He had done so easily the last time they moved, taking a house here in Bath. Still, she wished he might return early from London, before they departed.

Frown still in place, she glanced over, expecting Sir John with another edict.</p><p>Instead it was the butler, Hopkins. &#x201c;A caller for you, your ladyship.&#x201d;</p><p>Marianna&#x2019;s heart leapt.</p><p>&#x201c;It is Miss Rogers,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Are you at home, or shall I send her away?&#x201d;</p><p>Marianna&#x2019;s momentary elation deflated, but not completely.</p><p>&#x201c;Heavens no, don&#x2019;t send her away,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Show her into the morning room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, your ladyship.&#x201d; Hopkins bowed and departed.</p><p>The arrival of her former companion was certainly a surprise, considering how abruptly Hannah Rogers had left their employ a half year before&#x2014;but not an unhappy surprise. Glancing at her empty drawers and wardrobe with sinking heart, Marianna left her bedchamber and made her way downstairs.</p><p>A familiar, willowy figure rose at her entrance, assailing Marianna with waves of nostalgic fondness&#x2014;followed by betrayal that the woman had left without a word. She swallowed the bitter lump and began, &#x201c;Hannah! My goodness. I never expected to see you again.&#x201d;</p><p>The young woman met her gaze, expression tense. &#x201c;My lady.&#x201d;</p><p>Marianna smiled brightly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a godsend, an absolute godsend&#x2014;if I believed in such things. What timing! That you should come back now.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah Rogers clasped her hands tightly, and lowered her eyes. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I never received my final allowance.&#x201d;</p><p>Companions received a modest salary referred to as an allowance, not vulgar &#x201c;wages.&#x201d; Marianna had not expected the belated request, but didn&#x2019;t quibble.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you should have it. I never understood why you left without collecting your due.&#x201d; She rang a bell on the side table and Hopkins appeared.</p><p>&#x201c;Ask Mr. Ward to bring in Miss Rogers&#x2019;s remaining allowance, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>When the butler left the room, Marianna turned back to Hannah and asked, &#x201c;How have you been keeping?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Miss Rogers formed a tenuous smile. &#x201c;Well enough, thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>Unconvinced, Marianna sat and studied her, taking in the wary eyes, pale skin, and sharp cheekbones&#x2014;the hollows beneath more noticeable than she remembered.</p><p>&#x201c;You appear in good health,&#x201d; Marianna allowed. &#x201c;If a little tired. And thin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, my lady.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, be seated. I would offer you refreshment, but Sir John has seen fit to dismiss most of the servants already. We&#x2019;re down to Hopkins, Mr. Ward, and one maid.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah remained standing, but Marianna didn&#x2019;t press her. Instead, she tentatively asked, &#x201c;And have you found another situation? I awaited word from you, or request for a character reference, but nothing ever came.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I have another place, or did, until recently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Hope rising, Marianna asked, &#x201c;Are you not engaged at present?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Marianna rose and eagerly took the young woman&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Again, I say, what timing. For I am in dire need of a traveling companion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Traveling companion?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Sir John insists on uprooting us again. Just when I have begun to appreciate Bath society. But he will not yield, and so off we go.&#x201d; She laughed in artificial gaiety. &#x201c;Say you will come with me as my companion, Hannah. He won&#x2019;t even let me take my lady&#x2019;s maid. He&#x2019;s already dismissed her.&#x201d;</p><p>He would probably refuse to allow Miss Rogers to go with them as well, Marianna knew, but she had to try.</p><p>Hannah shook her head. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t leave Bath, my lady. Not now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must! I shall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. double your allowance to convince you. If Sir John does not agree, I shall use my own money.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah hesitated, then faltered, &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t even know where you are going.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nor do I! He won&#x2019;t even tell his own wife where we are bound. Isn&#x2019;t that a laugh? Thinks I&#x2019;ll tell a certain someone, which of course I would.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Hannah shook her head. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t leave at present. I have family here&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your father lives in Bristol.&#x201d; Marianna reminded her. &#x201c;And you left him when we moved here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was different.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t imagine it will be so much different,&#x201d; Marianna said breezily. &#x201c;I doubt we&#x2019;ll go far. The last time we only moved from Bristol to Bath&#x2014;as though a mere dozen miles would keep us apart.&#x201d;</p><p>She knew Hannah would understand the reference to her first love, whom Miss Rogers had met on several occasions.</p><p>Still Hannah hesitated. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, do come, Hannah. It won&#x2019;t be forever. If you don&#x2019;t like the place, or need to return to your family, you will be free to leave. You left before, after all, when it suited you.&#x201d; Marianna smiled to soften the words&#x2014;jab and assurance rolled into one.</p><p>She continued, &#x201c;I really can&#x2019;t bear this alone. Traveling with Sir John to some unknown place. No comforting presence between us. No familiar, friendly faces. He insists we hire all new servants when we arrive. We are not to take Hopkins or even Mr. Ward.&#x201d;</p><p>As if on cue, the door opened and her husband&#x2019;s secretary entered. She noticed Hannah stiffen.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Mr. Ward. You remember Hannah Rogers, I trust?&#x201d;</p><p>The thin man with thinner hair and pockmarked skin turned expressionless eyes her way. &#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lady. Left without notice, as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well, no matter. She has come for her allowance, which she is owed fairly, so no argument, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes glinted with displeasure or perhaps rebellion. &#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lady. Hopkins did inform me.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned stiffly to Miss Rogers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken a penalty from your <i>allowance</i>,&#x201d; he began in patronizing fashion, &#x201c;for leaving without proper notice, along with the eleven days you missed that quarter. Here is the remainder.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Rogers gingerly extended her palm, head bowed like a beggar. The man dropped several sovereigns and shillings onto her outstretched hand, smirking all the while.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Hannah mumbled.</p><p>He turned without a word and quit the room.</p><p>Watching him go, Marianna shivered. &#x201c;I cannot say I am sorry to leave him behind. Odious man. He is returning to Bristol to oversee Sir John&#x2019;s interests there.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah glanced down at the coins in her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful for the offer, my lady. I am. But I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. need to think about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Marianna Mayfield studied her. Something was different about Miss Rogers. What was it? &#x201c;Well don&#x2019;t think too long,&#x201d; Marianna said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving at four this afternoon, according to Sir John. Unless I can persuade him to forgo this idiotic notion. Jealous fool.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah looked up at her, expression torn. Almost miserable. She said, &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m not here by half past three, don&#x2019;t wait for me. It means I&#x2019;m not coming.&#x201d;</p><p>The hours passed all too quickly. The maid continued packing, and Marianna continued pacing. Still Anthony did not arrive. Nor did Hannah.</p><p>Marianna looked out the drawing room window toward the street. The traveling chariot had been moved to the front of the house, four horses now harnessed to it, the lead horse now and again stamping an eager hoof.</p><p>The maid, butler, and a hired lad stowed their belongings in the built-in imperial&#x2014;like a large, shallow valise atop the roof. More baggage rode in the rear, strapped in to the outside seat where two servants could have sat, had Sir John allowed her to take any with them.</p><p>At that moment, he strode into the room, imposing in his shooting jacket. He sternly insisted Marianna gather her hand luggage and prepare to depart so Hopkins could begin closing up the house. He turned on his heel and stalked away, his grim expression brooking no disagreement.</p><p>One of Marianna&#x2019;s friends had told her she was lucky to have a husband with such a decided, commanding manner. Marianna did not agree. But she knew further argument about staying would be futile. The house had already been sold. She glanced at her watch pin. Twenty after three.</p><p><i>Ten more minutes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Still hoping her former companion would arrive in time, she gathered her things and stepped outside.</p><p>Beside the carriage, Sir John spoke with a hired postilion, who would ride the lead horse for the first stage of the journey. They were taking no groom or guard. As Marianna approached, Sir John reached inside and extracted a flintlock rifle from the chariot&#x2019;s concealed gun case. He checked it, then returned it to its hiding place. Apparently, he would act as guard himself. Perhaps she ought be glad Anthony had not shown up after all.</p><p>Her gaze fell to her watch pin once more. Half past three. <i>Dash it.</i> She had so hoped Hannah would come.</p><p>Suddenly that very figure appeared at the end of Camden Place, where the crescent met Lansdown Street. Marianna&#x2019;s heart lifted. As she watched, a tall, dark-haired young man jogged after Hannah and snagged her by the elbow. They were too far away for Marianna to hear their conversation, but she saw Hannah shake her head and gently extract her arm from his grip. Resignation showed in her expression, but no fear. A suitor, perhaps? If so, no wonder Hannah hesitated to leave Bath.</p><p>Hannah turned away from the man and strode toward the carriage.</p><p>&#x201c;John, look,&#x201d; Marianna said. &#x201c;Miss Rogers has come to join us!&#x201d;</p><p>Her tall husband stiffened and turned to stare, expression inscrutable.</p><p>Hannah Rogers hurried toward them, valise bumping against her leg.</p><p>Marianna beamed. &#x201c;Oh, Hannah, how happy I am to see you! I dread making this journey, but I shall not mind nearly so much with you beside me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The offer still stands?&#x201d; Hannah asked, panting to catch her breath.</p><p>Marianna ignored her husband&#x2019;s glare and smiled at her would-be companion. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I may return if the situation doesn&#x2019;t suit?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well you won&#x2019;t be a prisoner, Hannah. I wish I could say the same for myself.&#x201d; She sent Sir John a pointed look. Waited for him to refuse. To insist that they travel alone.</p><p>His jaw clenched, but he said nothing.</p><p>The hired lad strapped Hannah&#x2019;s valise with the others, and the three entered the carriage, settling themselves onto the velvet cushions of the plush interior. Marianna reached up and fingered the golden tassels of the rich blue window draperies and murmured, &#x201c;What a pretty cage.&#x201d;</p><p>They rode through the night in uneasy silence, stopping to change horses at coaching inns along the way. Cramped and sleepy, Marianna sat as far away from Sir John as possible on the bench seat they shared. She leaned against the carriage wall and looked out the side window, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>The brass candle lamps glowed steadily beyond the windowpane. Eventually, night waned and dawn began to redden the sky, following their westward course along the Bristol Channel.</p><p>Miss Rogers, perched on the pull-down seat nearby, seemed to grow more restless with each passing mile. Brow furrowed, she bit her lip and twisted her long fingers again and again in her lap. Outside, a light drizzle began to fall, and if Marianna was not mistaken, her companion&#x2019;s eyes were damp as well.</p><p>As they entered yet another unknown hamlet and rumbled past its village green, the three of them stared out the window at a sobering sight: a pair of low-lying wooden stocks. Two women sat on the ground behind them, bound at the ankles. One woman scowled and swore at the jeering passersby. The other stared off into the distance with as much quiet dignity as the mortifying position allowed. Marianna wondered what each woman had been found guilty of. She was struck by how differently each faced the consequences of her actions, whatever they were. A chill passed up Marianna&#x2019;s neck. Would she face consequences for her own actions? She shrugged off the uncomfortable thought. Nothing would happen to her. It had not been her fault&#x2014;or her idea. And after all, they had gotten away with everything for more than two years now.</p><p>Sometime later, they stopped at another coaching inn. To that point, they had traveled with a team of four, driven by a succession of mounted postilions. But this inn had only two horses available, and how mismatched they were. The weary postilion departed, replaced by a fresh young man of nineteen or twenty. He converted the chariot&#x2019;s front box into a coachman&#x2019;s seat and from there, lifted the reins.</p><p>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be long now,&#x201d; Sir John said, continuing to survey the road behind them with wary eyes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re beginning the final short stretch of the journey.&#x201d;</p><p>As they left the inn yard, the drizzle swelled into a driving rain. The winds increased with each mile, howling and rocking the carriage.</p><p>They all lurched as the young driver pulled the horses to the side of the road and halted. He turned on his seat to face them through the front carriage window. Sir John opened the speaking flap to listen to what the young man had to say. Wind and rain garbled his words.</p><p>&#x201c;The roads are awful bad, sir. And the storm is picking up. I don&#x2019;t think it wise to go on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come lad, it cannot be much farther.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three miles, give or take.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And no inn before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir. But a farmer might let us shelter in his barn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A barn&#x2014;with these ladies? No. We must press on. I have a particular reason.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall make it worth your while.&#x201d; Through the flap, Sir John handed the young man a small bulging purse. &#x201c;And that much again when you deliver us there safely.&#x201d;</p><p>The young man&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He wiped the rain from his face and turned forward, allowing the flap to fall.</p><p>Marianna protested, &#x201c;John, the boy is right. It is foolish to press on and get us all killed.&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly, Hannah ...</p></p><h2>West Virginia Atlas &amp; Gazetteer (Delorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>Delorme, a travel planning resource.

In <em>John le Carr�</em>, Sisman shines a spotlight on David Cornwell, an expert at hiding in plain sight&#x2014;&#x201c;born to lying,&#x201d; he wrote in 2002, &#x201c;bred to it, trained to it by an industry that lies for a living, practiced in it as a novelist.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course, the pseudonym &#x201c;John le Carr�&#x201d; has helped to keep the public at a distance. Sisman probes Cornwell&#x2019;s unusual upbringing, abandoned by his mother at the age of only five and raised by his con man father (when not in prison), and explores his background in British intelligence, as well as his struggle to become a writer, and his personal life. Sisman has benefited from unfettered access to le Carr�&#x2019;s private archive, talked to the most important people in his life, and interviewed the man himself at length.</p><p>Who is John le Carr�? Intriguing, thorough, and packed with entertaining detail, this biography will be a treat for the legions of le Carr� fans.</p></p><p><p>Back in 1963,<em> The Spy Who Came in from the Cold </em>made its pseudonymous author, John le Carr�, a worldwide publishing sensation. Since then, le Carr� has produced another twenty-one bestselling novels. A master at weaving fiction with fact, le Carr� creates complex protagonists who expose tantalizing glimpses into the author&#x2019;s own character. But appearances are deceptive. The real truth is that David Cornwell, the man behind the pseudonym and one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated writers, has remained an enigma for more than half a century.</p><p>In this authoritative biography short-listed for the 2016 Pen Award, Adam Sisman explores how the central themes of Cornwell&#x2019;s life defined his fiction. From his lonely, &#x201c;hugless&#x201d; childhood to his early recruitment by British intelligence and the evolution of his spycraft, to his fraught roles as husband and family man, Cornwell&#x2019;s personal history encompasses the basic questions at the heart of his work: What does espionage mean in human terms? To what extent is betrayal acceptable in the name of love? How does a person manage the endless need for forgiveness, especially from oneself?</p><p>Written with exclusive access to David Cornwell, his private archive, and his family, friends, enemies, ex-intelligence colleagues, and ex-lovers&#x2014;and featuring a wealth of previously unseen photographic material&#x2014;Sisman&#x2019;s biography at last brings in from the cold a man whose life has been as complex, confounding, and filled with treachery as any of his novels.</p>ADAM SISMAN has written four previous biographies, including <i>An Honourable Englishman: The Life of Hugh Trevor-Roper</i>, <i>The Friendship: Wordsworth and Coleridge</i> and <i>Boswell's Presumptuous Task</i>, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize and received a National Books Critics Circle Award in 1999.</p><h2>Remembered Light: Cy Twombly in Lexington</h2><p>The artists Cy Twombly and Sally Mann may at first seem an unlikely pairing. He was a leading contemporary artist who defied easy categorization, a painter and sculptor whose enigmatic work often referenced mythology and epic poetry. She is a photographer with an uncanny ability to tap raw human emotion, whether depicting members of her family or the landscape of the American South. What they had in common was place&#x2014;both grew up in rural Lexington, Virginia, where Twombly kept a studio and produced some of his most important work until his death in 2011, and where Mann has lived and worked all her life. Over the course of several years, Mann photographed inside Twombly&#x2019;s studio: the paint splatters on the floor and walls, the works in progress, the sculptures as they caught the raking rays of light passing through Venetian blinds, the progression from order to chaos that so often characterizes an artist&#x2019;s working place. The result is a rare insider&#x2019;s view of Twombly&#x2019;s process&#x2014;we sense him in the room at every turn, although he is always just beyond the frame&#x2014;and a poetic dialogue between two artistic visions.</p><p><b>Sally Mann</b> is one of America&#x2019;s most renowned photographers.

Political instructors rammed home the message of Wehrmacht and SS brutality. The result was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known, with tanks crushing refugee columns under their tracks, mass rape, pillage and destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred because Nazi Party chiefs, refusing to face defeat, had forbidden the evacuation of civilians. Over seven million fled westwards from the terror of the Red Army.<br>Antony Beevor, using often devastating new material from former Soviet files, as well as from German, American, British, French and Swedish archives, has reconstructed the experiences of those millions caught up in the nightmare of the Third Reich's final collapse. Berlin - The Downfall 1945 is a terrible story of pride, stupidity, fanaticism, revenge and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing endurance, self-sacrifice and survival against all odds.</p><p>By December 1944, many of the 3 million citizens of Berlin had stopped giving the Nazi salute, and jokes circulated that the most practical Christmas gift of the season was a coffin. And for good reason, military historian Antony Beevor writes in this richly detailed reconstruction of events in the final days of Adolf Hitler's Berlin. Following savage years of campaigns in Russia, the Nazi regime had not only failed to crush Bolshevism, it had brought the Soviet army to the very gates of the capital. That army, ill-fed and hungry for vengeance, unloosed its fury on Berlin just a month later in a long siege that would cost hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides. But as Beevor recounts, the siege was also marked by remarkable acts of courage and even compassion. Drawing on unexplored Soviet and German archives and dozens of eyewitness accounts, Beevor brings us a harrowing portrait of the battle and its terrible aftermath, which would color world history for years to follow. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Antony Beevor is the author of Crete: The Battle and the Resistance (Runciman Prize), Stalingrad (Samuel Johnson Prize, Wolfson Prize for History and Hawthornden Prize), Berlin: The Downfall, The Battle for Spain (Premio La Vanguardia), D-Day: The Battle for Normandy (Prix Henry Malherbe and the RUSI Westminster Medal), The Second World War, and Ardennes 1944 (Prix Medicis shortlist). The number one bestselling historian in Britain, Beevor&#39;s books have appeared in thirty-two languages and have sold just over seven million copies.

He virtually invented modern stand-up comedy. Above all, he helped redefine the very notion of what it means to be a star: a savvy businessman, an enterprising builder of his own brand, and a public-spirited entertainer whose Christmas military tours and unflagging work for charity set the standard for public service in Hollywood.<br> <br>As Richard Zoglin shows in this &#x201c;entertaining and important book&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>), there is still much to be learned about this most public of figures, from his secret first marriage and his stint in reform school, to his indiscriminate womanizing and his ambivalent relationships with Bing Crosby and Johnny Carson. Hope could be cold, self-centered, tight with a buck, and perhaps the least introspective man in Hollywood. But he was also a tireless worker, devoted to his fans, and generous with friends.<br> <br>&#x201c;Scrupulously researched, likely definitive, and as entertaining and as important (to an understanding of twentieth- and twenty-first-century pop culture) as its subject once genuinely was&#x201d; (<i>Vanity Fair</i>), <i>Hope</i> is both a celebration of the entertainer and a complex portrait of a gifted but flawed man. &#x201c;A wonderful biography,&#x201d; says Woody Allen. &#x201c;For me, it&#x2019;s a feast.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard Zoglin is a contributing editor and theater critic for&nbsp;<i>Time </i>magazine.

They were a well-dressed group&#x2014;the men in jackets and ties, the women in business suits. Many were quite old and needed help climbing into the boat that had been chartered to ferry them across New York Harbor to Ellis Island. Once there, they made their way to the second floor of the cavernous Immigration Museum building, where rows of chairs had been set up in a long, book-lined room, which was about to be dedicated as the Bob Hope Memorial Library.<br> <br>Linda Hope, the late comedian&#x2019;s seventy-one-year-old daughter, stepped to the microphone to emcee the ceremony. She introduced the smattering of celebrities on hand&#x2014;actress Arlene Dahl, baseball legend Yogi Berra, two US congressmen&#x2014;and several clip reels highlighting Bob&#x2019;s life and career: his childhood years in England, where he was born in 1903, and Cleveland, Ohio, where he and his family emigrated when he was four and a half; scenes from his movies and TV shows; excerpts from his tours to entertain US troops around the globe. His granddaughter, Miranda, accompanying herself on guitar, sang a folk ballad called &#x201c;Immigrant Eyes.&#x201d; Dick Cavett popped up from the audience to tell a couple of impromptu stories about Hope, whom he had befriended in the comedian&#x2019;s later years. Michael Feinstein, the cabaret singer and musical archivist, closed the event with a wistful solo rendition of Bob&#x2019;s theme song, &#x201c;Thanks for the Memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was another chapter in what has surely been the most determined campaign of legacy building in Hollywood history. A few months before the Ellis Island ceremony, Hope&#x2019;s family and friends gathered in Washington, DC, to inaugurate a new Hope-centric exhibit on political humor at the Library of Congress, where the comedian&#x2019;s voluminous letters and papers are stored. A year earlier, the Hope legacy tour made a stop on the deck of the USS Midway in San Diego Harbor to mark the introduction of a postage stamp bearing Hope&#x2019;s likeness. Memorials to Hope have proliferated across the American landscape. You can walk down streets named for Bob Hope in El Paso, Texas, Miami, Florida, and Branson, Missouri; cross the Cuyahoga River on the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio; and bypass the congestion at Los Angeles International by flying into the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. Hope&#x2019;s name is memorialized on hospitals, theaters, chapels, schools, performing arts centers, and American Legion posts from Miami to Okinawa. The US Air Force named a transport plane for him, and the Navy christened a cargo ship in his honor. Bob Hope Village, in Shalimar, Florida, provides a home for retired members of the Air Force and their surviving spouses. The World Golf Hall of Fame, in St. Augustine, Florida, features an exhibit celebrating Hope&#x2019;s passion for the game, &#x201c;Bob Hope: Shanks for the Memory.&#x201d; A dozen colleges offer scholarships in Hope&#x2019;s name. Another dozen organizations give out awards in his honor, among them the Air Force&#x2019;s annual Spirit of Hope Award and the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, presented by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Science.<br> <br>His punchy, two-syllable name, so emblematic of the optimistic American spirit; the unmistakable profile, with its jutting chin and famously ski-slope-shaped nose; the indelible images of Hope performing for throngs of cheering GIs in World War II and Vietnam&#x2014;it was once impossible to imagine a time when the first question that needed to be answered about the most popular comedian in American history would be: Who was Bob Hope, and why did he matter?<br> <br>By the time he died&#x2014;on July 27, 2003, two months after his hundredth birthday&#x2014;Hope&#x2019;s reputation was already fading, tarnished, or being actively disparaged. He had, unfortunately, stuck around too long. The comedian of the century, who began his vaudeville career in the 1920s and was still headlining TV specials in the 1990s, continued performing well into his dotage, and a younger generation knew him mainly as a cue-card-reading antique, cracking dated jokes about buxom beauty queens and Gerald Ford&#x2019;s golf game. &#x201c;World&#x2019;s Last Bob Hope Fan Dies of Old Age,&#x201d; the Onion&#x2019;s fake headline announced a year before his death. Writer Christopher Hitchens expressed the disaffection of many of the baby-boom generation in an online dismissal of Hope just a few days after his passing: &#x201c;To be paralyzingly, painfully, hopelessly unfunny is a serious drawback, even lapse, in a comedian. And the late Bob Hope devoted a fantastically successful and well-remunerated lifetime to showing that a truly unfunny man can make it as a comic. There is a laugh here, but it is on us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope never recovered from the Vietnam years, when his hawkish defense of the war, close ties to President Nixon (who actively courted Hope&#x2019;s help in selling his Vietnam policies to the American people), and the country-club smugness of his gibes about antiwar protesters and long-haired hippies, all made him a political pariah for the peace-and-love generation. His tours to entertain US troops during World War II had made him a national hero. By the turbulent 1960s, he was a court-approved jester, the Establishment&#x2019;s comedian&#x2014;hardly a badge of honor in an era when hipper, more subversive comics, from Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce to George Carlin and Richard Pryor, were showing that stand-up comedy could be a vehicle for personal expression, social criticism, and political protest. Even before Hope became a doddering relic, he had become an anachronism.<br> <br>Yet the scope of Hope&#x2019;s achievement, viewed from the distance of a few years, is almost unimaginable. By nearly any measure, he was the most popular entertainer of the twentieth century, the only one who achieved success&#x2014;often No. 1&#x2013;rated success&#x2014;in every major genre of mass entertainment in the modern era: vaudeville, Broadway, movies, radio, television, popular song, and live concerts. He virtually invented stand-up comedy in the form we know it today. His face, voice, and stage mannerisms (the nose, the lopsided smile, the confident, sashaying walk, and the ever-present golf club) made him more recognizable to more people than any other entertainer since Charlie Chaplin. A tireless stage performer who traveled the country and the world for more than half a century doing live shows for audiences in the thousands, he may well have been seen in person by more people than any other human being in history.<br> <br>His achievements as an entertainer, however, only hint at the breadth and depth of his impact. For the way he marketed himself, managed his celebrity, cultivated his brand, and converted his show-business fame into a larger, more consequential role for himself on the public stage, Bob Hope was the most important entertainer of the century. Viewed from the largest historical perspective&#x2014;the way he intersects with the grand themes of the century, from the Greatest Generation&#x2019;s crusade to preserve democracy in World War II, to the social, political, and cultural upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s&#x2014;one could argue, without too much exaggeration, that he was the only important entertainer.<br> <br>His life almost perfectly spanned the century, and to recount his career is to recapitulate the history of modern American show business. He began in vaudeville, first as a song-and-dance man and then as an emcee and comedian, working his way up from the amateur shows of his Cleveland hometown to headlining at New York&#x2019;s legendary Palace Theatre. He segued to Broadway, where he costarred in some of the era&#x2019;s classic musicals, appeared with legends such as Fanny Brice and Ethel Merman, and introduced standards by great American composers such as Jerome Kern and Cole Porter. Hope became a national star on radio, hosting a weekly comedy show on NBC that was America&#x2019;s No. 1&#x2013;rated radio program for much of the early 1940s and remained in the top five for more than a decade.<br> <br>He came relatively late to Hollywood, making his feature-film debut, at age thirty-four, in The Big Broadcast of 1938, where he sang &#x201c;Thanks for the Memory&#x201d;&#x2014;which became his universally identifiable, infinitely adaptable theme song and the first of many pop standards that, almost as a sideline, he introduced in movies. With an almost nonstop string of box-office hits such as The Cat and the Canary, Caught in the Draft, Monsieur Beaucaire, The Paleface, and the popular Road pictures with Bing Crosby, Hope ranked among Hollywood&#x2019;s top ten box-office stars for a decade, reaching the No. 1 spot in 1949.<br> <br>Hope brought a new kind of character and attitude to the movies. He was the brash but self-mocking wise guy, a braggart who turned chicken in the face of danger, a skirt chaser who quivered like Jell-O when the skirt chased back. &#x201c;I grew up loving him, emulating him, and borrowing from him,&#x201d; said Woody Allen, one of the few comics to acknowledge how much he was influenced by Hope&#x2014;though nearly everyone was. Hope played variations on his cowardly character in spy comedies, ghost stories, costume epics, Westerns&#x2014;but always with a winking nod to the audience, an acknowledgment that he was an actor playing a role. Especially in his interplay with Crosby in the Road films, Hope often spoke directly to the camera or stepped out of character to make cracks about the studio, his career, and his Hollywood friends. This improvisational, fourth-wall-breaking spirit was a radical break from the stylized sophistication of the 1930s romantic comedies, or the artifice of other vaudeville comics who transitioned into movies, such as W. C. Fields or the Marx Brothers. And it perfectly met the psychological needs of a nation at a time of war and world crisis. As the newsreels broadcast scenes of thundering European dictators, jackbooted military troops, and docile, mindlessly cheering crowds, Hope&#x2019;s humor was both an escape and an affirmation of the American spirit: feisty, independent, indomitable.<br> <br>When television came in, Hope was there too. Others, such as Milton Berle, preceded him. But after starring in his first NBC special on Easter Sunday in 1950, Hope began an unparalleled reign as NBC&#x2019;s most popular comedy star that lasted for nearly four decades. Other comedians who made the move into television&#x2014;Berle, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, even Lucille Ball&#x2014;had their heyday on TV and then faded; Hope alone remained a major star headlining top-rated TV shows well into his eighties. His 1970 Christmas special from Vietnam was the most watched television program of all time up to that point, seen in a now-unthinkable 46.6 percent of all TV homes in the country. (The final episodes of Dallas, M*A*S*H, and Roots are the only entertainment shows ever to beat it.)<br> <br>That would have been enough for most performers, but not Hope. Along with his radio, TV, and movie work, he traveled for personal appearances at a pace matched by no other major star. He was just one of many performers who went overseas on USO-sponsored tours to entertain the troops during World War II. Unlike most of the others, he didn&#x2019;t stop when the war ended. Starting with a trip to Berlin during a Cold War crisis in 1948, he launched an annual tradition of entertaining US troops around the world at Christmas&#x2014;in wartime and peacetime, from forlorn outposts in Alaska to the battlefields of Korea and Vietnam. Stateside, he was just as indefatigable, making as many as 250 personal appearances a year, manning the microphone at charity benefits, trade shows, state fairs, testimonial dinners, hospital dedications, Boy Scout jamborees, Kiwanis Club luncheons, and seemingly any event that could pack a thousand people into a ballroom on the promise that Bob Hope would be there to deliver the one-liners.<br> <br>On a podium, no one could touch him. He was host or cohost of the Academy Awards ceremony a record nineteen times&#x2014;the first in 1940, when Gone With the Wind was the big winner, and the last in 1978, when Star Wars and Annie Hall were the hot films. His suave unflappability&#x2014;no one ever looked better in a tuxedo&#x2014;and tart insider wisecracks (&#x201c;This is the night when war and politics are forgotten, and we find out who we really hate&#x201d;) helped turn a relatively low-key industry dinner into the most obsessively tracked and massively watched event of the Hollywood year.<br> <br>The modern stand-up comedy monologue was essentially his creation. There were comedians in vaudeville before Hope, but they mostly worked in pairs or did prepackaged, jokebook gags that played on ethnic stereotypes and other familiar comedy tropes. Hope, working as an emcee and ad-libbing jokes about the acts he introduced, developed a more freewheeling and spontaneous monologue style, which he later honed and perfected in radio. To keep his material fresh, he hired a team of writers and told them to come up with jokes about the news of the day&#x2014;presidential politics, Hollywood gossip, California weather, as well as his own life, work, travels, golf game, and show-business friends.<br> <br>This was something of a revolution. When Hope made his debut on NBC in 1938, the popular comedians on radio all inhabited self-contained worlds, playing largely invented comic characters: Jack Benny&#x2019;s effete tightwad, Edgar Bergen and his uppity dummy, Charlie McCarthy, the daffy-wife/exasperated-husband interplay of George Burns and Gracie Allen. Hope&#x2019;s monologues brought something new to radio: a connection between the comedian and the outside world.<br> <br>Hope was not the first comedian to do jokes about current events. Will Rogers, the Oklahoma-born humorist who offered folksy and often pointed commentary on politics and the American scene, achieved huge popularity in vaudeville, movies, and radio in the 1920s and 1930s, before his death in a plane crash in 1935. Fred Allen, the frog-voiced radio satirist, was aiming acerbic and literate barbs at the potentates of both Washington and his own network while Hope was still apprenticing. But Hope was the first to combine topical subject matter with the rapid-fire gag rhythms of the vaudeville quipster. His monologues became the template for Johnny Carson and nearly every late-night TV host who followed him, and the foundation stone for all stand-up comics, even those who rebelled against him.<br> <br>Hope wasn&#x2019;t a political satirist. His jokes never hit hard, cut deep, or betrayed any political viewpoint. Mostly they took personalities and events from the news and lampooned them for superficial things, or with clever wordplay&#x2014;an ironic juxtaposition or unexpected twist or jokey hyperbole. &#x201c;Not much has been happening back home,&#x201d; Hope told a crowd of servicemen after the 1960 presidential election. &#x201c;Hawaii and Alaska joined the union, and the Republicans left it.&#x201d; He poked fun at new California governor Ronald Reagan for his Hollywood pedigree, not his conservative politics: &#x201c;California&#x2019;s back to a two-party system: the Democrats and the Screen Actors Guild.&#x201d; When Bobby Kennedy was thinking of running for president, Hope joked about the candidate&#x2019;s growing brood of kids: &#x201c;He may win the next election without leaving the house.&#x201d; On hot-button issues such as gay rights, Hope&#x2019;s gags amiably skirted any potential land mines: &#x201c;In California homosexuality is legal. I&#x2019;m getting out before they make it mandatory.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was the first comedian to openly acknowledge that he used writers&#x2014;as many as a dozen at a time, turning out hundreds of potential jokes for each monologue. He saved them all, the keepers and the castoffs, in a firepro...</p><h2>The Art of Being You: How to Live as God&#39;s Masterpiece</h2><p>I heard a well-known Christian musician say at a concert that God was in the business of fixing broken people. I went home and thought about that for a while, and I came to a different conclusion... That different conclusion, reached by singer/songwriter Bob Kilpatrick, has some interesting and exciting applications for re-thinking what it means to be a Christian. Rather than casting God in the usual role as architect and great mechanic of the universe, Kilpatrick instead paints a portrait of God as an artist&#x2015;passionate, visionary&#x2015;who considers humankind his masterpiece. God doesn't see Christians as broken beings chugging along in a fixed-up life. He sees us as new creations, whole, complete, and a stunning part of his creative process. It's a powerful perception of God, one that determines how much we understand and enjoy God, which, in turn, affects the entire course of our lives. We'll stop perceiving God based on what we lack, what we need repaired, and how weak we are, and come to know God as a creator who sees each one of us as a work of beauty and value. If we believe our relationship with God is one of artist/masterpiece/creative process, then we have every reason to rejoice in every stage of that process. The Art of Being You offers every reason to believe that God is preparing us for an amazing heavenly display.</p><p><p>Bob Kilpatrick is&nbsp;the composer of the classic worship songs In My Life, Lord, Be Glorified, Won By One, Ask Of Me (Here Am I) and I Will Not Be Ashamed, and&nbsp;the author of three books.&nbsp;&nbsp;His songs have been used by every major Christian record company on millions of CDs and songbooks.

Author McPherson manages to find a unique perspective on the Lincoln presidency as he explores Lincoln&#39;s role and effectiveness as commander-in-chief during the Civil War. Burdened as he was with generals either reluctant or unable to perform, Lincoln was forced to learn military strategy and to conduct much of the war from the White House. McPherson also draws an intimate portrait of Lincoln: his triumphs and frustrations, self-doubt and anguish as the casualties on both sides mount. George Guidall is an excellent fit for McPherson&#39;s detailed text. His smooth presentation and brisk pacing bring a clarity and energy that will help this work appeal to a wide audience.

Basbanes continues the lively, richly anecdotal exploration of book people, places, and culture he began in 1995 with A Gentle Madness (a finalist that year for the National Book Critics Circle Award) and expanded in 2001 with Patience &amp; Fortitude, a companion work that prompted the two-time Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian and biographer David McCullough to proclaim him "the leading authority of books about books."</p><p>Basbanes now offers a consideration of the many pressing issues that surround the role of books in contemporary society, such as the willful destruction of books and libraries in Sarajevo, Tibet, and Cambodia, and the spirited efforts to restore them. The matter of "discards" at various libraries takes on an entirely new dimension as well, with fully researched stories about the kind of attitudes that may lead to the loss of &#x201c;last copies&#x201d; of important works.</p><p>In vivid detail, Basbanes examines the many materials that have been used over the centuries to record information -- among them clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, slabs of stone, palm leaves, animal skins, and hammered sheets of gold and copper. Also discussed are the various debates that continue to rage about preservation, which may mean saving and storing books on paper indefinitely, or as electronic data, which are by nature ephemeral. </p><p>In this beautifully packaged edition, Nicholas Basbanes brings to a close his wonderful trilogy on the remarkable world of books and bibliophiles.</p></p><p><p>Nicholas A. Basbanes has worked as an award-winning investigative reporter, a literary editor, and a nationally syndicated columnist. The author of five books, he also writes a regular column for <em>Fine Books &amp; Collections</em> magazine and lectures widely on book-related issues. He and his wife, Constance, live in Massachusetts.</p>The final volume in an acclaimed trilogy for bibliophiles (after A Gentle Madness and Patience &amp; Fortitude) focuses on efforts to preserve books and other printed matter from the ravages of deterioration, destruction and obsolescence. The historical range here is expansive, encompassing texts by classical authors known today only through secondhand descriptions, William Blake's self-published illustrated volumes and used book sales at modern libraries. Even the most ancillary data have the power to fascinate: who knew, for example, that the Roman emperor Claudius was also probably the last scholar fluent in the language of the ancient Etruscans? But the research skills Basbanes displays are matched by the lively quality of his interviews, like an extended conversation with a Sarajevo librarian who saved thousands of Croatian volumes from the Serbian ethnic cleansing campaign. Other chapters, which describe how American libraries are regularly pruned of old books by less violent means, owe a heavy (and acknowledged) debt to Nicholson Baker's Double Fold, with minor updates to recap new trends in preservation. A final section elaborates on the potential threat of the e-book, but remains optimistic that love of the physical act of reading will enable the printed page to prevail. Even those who find the evidence unconvincing should find themselves compelled by story after story on the salvation of books. Basbanes's longtime fans will rejoice at more of the same, while new readers will no doubt be swiftly caught up in the book-loving spirit. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Middle Pillar (Llewellyn&#39;s High Magick Series)</h2><p>Discusses the relationship between Jung&#39;s analytic psychology and hermetic magic, looking at cabala, yoga, Eastern religion, and the pentagram</p><p></p><h2>Commentary on the American Prayer Book</h2><p>Traces and comments upon the sources, history, and development of each of the rites and formularies of the book from the earliest known forms until the present day.</p><p></p><h2>Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights: 1919-1950</h2><p><p><strong>A groundbreaking history of the Southern movement for social justice that gave birth to civil rights.</strong></p> The civil rights movement that loomed over the 1950s and 1960s was the tip of an iceberg, the legal and political remnant of a broad, raucous, deeply American movement for social justice that flourished from the 1920s through the 1940s. This contentious mix of home-grown radicals, labor activists, newspaper editors, black workers, and intellectuals employed every strategy imaginable to take Dixie down, from a ludicrous attempt to organize black workers with a stage production of Pushkin&#x2015;in Russian&#x2015;to the courageous fight of striking workers against police and corporate violence in Gastonia in 1929. In a dramatic narrative Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore deftly shows how the movement unfolded against national and global developments, gaining focus and finally arriving at a narrow but effective legal strategy for securing desegregation and political rights. Little-known heroes abound in a book that will recast our understanding of the most important social movement in twentieth-century America.</p><p>Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore is the Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Professor of History, African American Studies, and American Studies at Yale University. Her research interests include twentieth-century U.S. history; African American history since 1865; U.S. women's and gender history since 1865; history of the American South; and reform movements. Her publications include Norton&#x2019;s Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights, 1919-1950, which was one of the American Library Association&#x2019;s Notable Books and the Washington Post&#x2019;s Best Books of 2008, and she edited Who Were the Progressives? and co-edited Jumpin&#x2019; Jim Crow: Southern Politics from Civil War to Civil Rights. Her first book, Gender and Jim Crow: Women and the Politics of White Supremacy in North Carolina, 1896-1920, won the Frederick Jackson Turner Award, the James A. Rawley Prize, the Julia Cherry Spruill Prize, and the Heyman Prize.Yale historian Gilmore turns a wide lens on the battle against Jim Crow in this worthy if overstuffed collective biography of the black and white Southern activists whose work before the larger Civil Rights movement constitute its neglected, forgotten or repressed origins. Expanding the temporal and geographical boundaries of the fight for racial equality, Gilmore's scholarship considers international racial politics and traces a progression from 1920s Communists, who joined forces in the late 1930s with a radical left to form a Southern popular front, to the 1940s grassroots activists. Gilmore (<i>Who Were the Progressives?</i>) lavishes attention on the first American-born black Communist, Lovett Fort-Whiteman, who died in a Siberian gulag in 1939; and on FDR-era civil rights activist Pauli Murray, distinguished by her fight against segregation at the University of North Carolina in 1939 and her involvement in the defense of Virginia sharecropper Odell Walker, ultimately executed for killing his white landlord. Gilmore's sweeping, fresh consideration of pre-movement civil rights activity, with its links to both the exportation of American racism and the importation of Communist egalitarianism, is full of informative gems, but the mining is left to the reader. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives with his wife, author Gloria Jean, in Westchester County, NY.Grade 2 Up Recent retellings of Joel Chandler Harris' African-American folktales from former slaves have pruned the dialect and leave out Uncle Remus all together. Most notable of these is Jump!: the Adventures of Brer Rabbit (HBJ, 1986). This newest attempt brings together two distinguished children's book creators in a most unusual recreation. Lester has retold 48 of the folktales in standard English but with a strong feel for the dialect of the original stories. His retellings are as lively as the originals but they also have a liveliness of their own, as he incorporates modern allusions which never seem out of place. Even more importantly, he uses the sharp, witty Uncle Remus who narrated the original folktales, and not the more servile character from the opening and closing segments who many found offensive. Pinkney's illustrations are mostly black-and-white sketches with some full-color double-page spreads. They do not have the sass of the original A. B. Frost illustrations, but they are filled with strong interest and a great humor which serves the text well. This will be of great interest to school and public libraries as well as to storytellers as a source which gives new life to an American classic. Kay McPherson, Central Atlanta-Fulton Public Library<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank: Stories</h2><p>These eight new stories from the celebrated novelist and short-story writer Nathan Englander display a gifted young author grappling with the great questions of modern life, with a command of language and the imagination that place Englander at the very forefront of contemporary American fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> The title story, inspired by Raymond Carver&#x2019;s masterpiece, is a provocative portrait of two marriages in which the Holocaust is played out as a devastating parlor game. In the outlandishly dark &#x201c;Camp Sundown&#x201d; vigilante justice is undertaken by a group of geriatric campers in a bucolic summer enclave. &#x201c;Free Fruit for Young Widows&#x201d; is a small, sharp study in evil, lovingly told by a father to a son. &#x201c;Sister Hills&#x201d; chronicles the history of Israel&#x2019;s settlements from the eve of the Yom Kippur War through the present, a political fable constructed around the tale of two mothers who strike a terrible bargain to save a child. Marking a return to two of Englander&#x2019;s classic themes, &#x201c;Peep Show&#x201d; and &#x201c;How We Avenged the Blums&#x201d; wrestle with sexual longing and ingenuity in the face of adversity and peril. And &#x201c;Everything I Know About My Family on My Mother&#x2019;s Side&#x201d; is suffused with an intimacy and tenderness that break new ground for a writer who seems constantly to be expanding the parameters of what he can achieve in the short form.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beautiful and courageous, funny and achingly sad, Englander&#x2019;s work is a revelation.</p><p>Nathan Englander&#x2019;s short fiction has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, </i>and numerous anthologies, including <i>The Best American Short Stories </i>and <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories. </i>Englander is the author<i> </i>of the novel <i>The Ministry of Special Cases </i>and the story collection <i>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges, </i>which earned him a PEN/Malamud Award and the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> www.nathanenglander.com<i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</i><br><br>They&#x2019;re in our house maybe ten minutes and already Mark&#x2019;s lecturing us on the Israeli occupation. Mark and Lauren live in Jerusalem, and people from there think it gives them the right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark is looking all stoic and nodding his head. &#x201c;If we had what you have down here in South Florida . . . ,&#x201d; he says, and trails off. &#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; he says, and he&#x2019;s nodding again. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d have no troubles at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You <i>do </i>have what we have,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;All of it. Sun and palm trees. Old Jews and oranges and the worst drivers around. At this point,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve probably got more Israelis than you.&#x201d; Debbie, my wife, she puts a hand on my arm. Her signal that I&#x2019;m taking a tone, or interrupting someone&#x2019;s story, sharing something private, or making an inappropriate joke. That&#x2019;s my cue, and I&#x2019;m surprised, considering how much I get it, that she ever lets go of my arm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;ve got it all now,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Even terrorists.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look to Lauren. She&#x2019;s the one my wife has the relation- ship with&#x2014;the one who should take charge. But Lauren isn&#x2019;t going to give her husband any signal. She and Mark ran off to Israel twenty years ago and turned Hassidic, and neither of them will put a hand on the other in public. Not for this. Not to put out a fire.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t Mohamed Atta living right here before 9/11?&#x201d; Mark says, and now he pantomimes pointing out houses. &#x201c;Goldberg, Goldberg, Goldberg&#x2014;Atta. How&#x2019;d you miss him in this place?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Other side of town,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about. That&#x2019;s what you have that we don&#x2019;t. Other sides of town. Wrong sides of the tracks. Space upon space.&#x201d; And now he&#x2019;s fingering a granite countertop in our kitchen, looking out into the living room and the dining room, staring through the kitchen windows out at the pool. &#x201c;All this house,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;and one son? Can you imagine?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Lauren says. And then she turns to us, backing him up. &#x201c;You should see how we live with ten.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ten kids,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;We could get you a reality show with that here in the States. Help you get a bigger place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The hand is back pulling at my sleeve. &#x201c;Pictures,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;I want to see the girls.&#x201d; We all follow Lauren into the den for her purse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you believe it?&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;Ten girls!&#x201d; And the way it comes out of his mouth, it&#x2019;s the first time I like the guy. The first time I think about giving him a chance.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> Facebook and Skype brought Deb and Lauren back together. They were glued at the hip growing up. Went to school together their whole lives. Yeshiva school. All girls. Out in Queens through high school and then riding the subway together to one called Central in Manhattan. They stayed best friends forever until I married Deb and turned her secular, and soon after that Lauren met Mark and they went off to the Holy Land and went from Orthodox to <i>ultra</i>-Orthodox, which to me sounds like a repackaged detergent&#x2014;ORTHODOX ULTRA�, now with more deep-healing power. Because of that, we&#x2019;re sup- posed to call them Shoshana and Yerucham. Deb&#x2019;s been doing it. I&#x2019;m just not saying their names.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want some water?&#x201d; I offer. &#x201c;Coke in the can?&#x201d; &#x201c; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;&#x2014;which of us?&#x201d; Mark says. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>You </i>both,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got whiskey. Whiskey&#x2019;s kosher, too,<br> right?&#x201d; &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not, I&#x2019;ll kosher it up real fast,&#x201d; he says, pretending<br> to be easygoing. And right then, he takes off that big black hat and plops down on the couch in the den.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lauren&#x2019;s holding the verticals aside and looking out at the yard. &#x201c;Two girls from Forest Hills,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Who ever thought we&#x2019;d be the mothers of grown-ups?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Trevor&#x2019;s sixteen,&#x201d; Deb says. &#x201c;You may think he&#x2019;s a grown-up, and he may think he&#x2019;s a grown-up&#x2014;but we, we are not convinced.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Lauren says, &#x201c;then whoever thought we&#x2019;d have kids raised to think it&#x2019;s normal to have coconuts crashing out back and lizards climbing the walls?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Right then is when Trev comes padding into the den, all six feet of him, plaid pajama bottoms dragging on the floor and T-shirt full of holes. He&#x2019;s just woken up and you can tell he&#x2019;s not sure if he&#x2019;s still dreaming. We told him we had guests. But there&#x2019;s Trev, staring at this man in the black suit, a beard rest- ing on the middle of his stomach. And Lauren, I&#x2019;d met her once before, right when Deb and I got married, but ten girls and a thousand Shabbos dinners later&#x2014;well, she&#x2019;s a big woman, in a bad dress and a giant blond Marilyn Monroe wig. Seeing them at the door, I can&#x2019;t say I wasn&#x2019;t shocked myself. But the boy, he can&#x2019;t hide it on his face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Deb&#x2019;s on him, preening and fixing his hair and hugging him. &#x201c;Trevy, this is my best friend from childhood,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;This is Shoshana, and this is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mark,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yerucham,&#x201d; Mark says, and sticks out a hand. Trev shakes it. Then Trev sticks out his hand, polite, to Lauren. She looks at it, just hanging there in the air&#x2014;offered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t shake,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m so happy to see you. Like meeting my own son. I mean it,&#x201d; she says. And here she starts to cry, for real. And she and Deb are hugging and Deb&#x2019;s crying, too. And the boys, we just stand there until Mark looks at his watch and gets himself a good manly grip on Trev&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sleeping until three on a Sunday? Man, those were the days,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;A regular little Rumpleforeskin.&#x201d; Trev looks at me, and I want to shrug, but Mark&#x2019;s also looking, so I don&#x2019;t move. Trev just gives us both his best teenage glare and edges out of the room. As he does, he says, &#x201c;Baseball practice,&#x201d; and takes my car keys off the hook by the door to the garage.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s gas,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;They let them drive here at sixteen?&#x201d; Mark says. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Insane.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what brings you,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;after all these years?&#x201d; Deb&#x2019;s too far away to grab at me, but her face says it all. &#x201c;Was I sup- posed to know?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Jeez, Deb must have told me. She told me, for sure. My fault.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My mother,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s failing and my father&#x2019;s get- ting old&#x2014;and they come to us for Sukkot every year. You know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know the holidays,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They used to fly out to us. For Sukkot and Pesach, both. But they can&#x2019;t fly now, and I just wanted to get over while things are still good. We haven&#x2019;t been in America&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, gosh,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid to think how long it&#x2019;s been. More than ten years. Twelve,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Twelve years ago. With the kids, it&#x2019;s just impossible until enough of them are big. This might be&#x201d;&#x2014;and now she plops down on the couch&#x2014;&#x201c;this might be my first time in a house with no kids under the roof in that long. Oh my. I&#x2019;m serious. How weird. I feel faint. And when I say <i>faint</i>,&#x201d; she says, standing up, giving an oddly girlish spin around, &#x201c;what I mean is giddy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do you do it?&#x201d; Deb says. &#x201c;Ten kids? I really do want to hear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s when I remember. &#x201c;I forgot your drink,&#x201d; I say to Mark.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, his drink. That&#x2019;s how,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how we cope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> And that&#x2019;s how the four of us end up back at the kitchen table with a bottle of vodka between us. I&#x2019;m not one to get drunk on a Sunday afternoon, but I tell you, with a plan to spend the day with Mark, I jump at the chance. Deb&#x2019;s drinking, too, but not for the same reason. For her and Lauren, I think they&#x2019;re reliving a little bit of the wild times. The very small window when they were together, barely grown-up, two young women living in New York on the edge of two worlds. And they just look, the both of them, so overjoyed to be reunited, I think they&#x2019;re half celebrating and half can&#x2019;t handle how intense the whole thing is.<br> Deb says, as she&#x2019;s already on her second, &#x201c;This is really racy for us. I mean <i>really </i>racy. We try not to drink much at all these days. We think it sets a bad example for Trevor. It&#x2019;s not good to drink in front of them right at that age when they&#x2019;re all transgressive. He&#x2019;s suddenly so interested in that kind of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just happy when he&#x2019;s interested in something,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deb slaps at the air. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s good to make drinking look like it&#x2019;s fun with a teenager around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lauren smiles and straightens her wig. &#x201c;Does anything we do look fun to our kids?&#x201d; I laugh at that. Honestly, I&#x2019;m really liking her more and more.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the age limit that does it,&#x201d;...</p><h2>What the Hell Did I Just Read: A Novel of Cosmic Horror (John Dies at the End, 3)</h2><p><p>It's the story "They" don't want you to read.

So with pen in hand, she embarked on a journey that forever changed her-and many others around the world. In these powerful pages are the words and Scriptures Jesus lovingly laid on her heart. Words of reassurance, comfort, and hope. Words that have made her increasingly aware of His presence and allowed her to enjoy His peace. Jesus is calling out to you in the same way. Maybe you share the author&#39;s need for a great sense of &#34;God with you&#34;. Or perhaps Jesus seems distant without you knowing why. Or maybe you have wandered farther from Him that you ever imagined you would. Here is a year&#39;s worth of daily readings from Young&#39;s journals to bring you closer to Christ and move your time with Him from monologue to a dialogue. Each day is written as if Jesus Himself were speaking to you. Because He is.

It was a humble project that for years existed quietly on a hillside east of town. Life at the Masonic Home was about to change, though, with the arrival of a lean, bespectacled coach by the name of Rusty Russell. Here was a man who could bring rain in the midst of a drought. Here was a man who, in virtually no time at all, brought the orphans' story into the homes of millions of Americans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing bigger in Texas high school football than the Masonic Home Mighty Mites--a group of orphans bound together by hardship and death. These youngsters, in spite of being outweighed by at least thirty pounds per man, were the toughest football team around. They began with nothing--not even a football--yet in a few years were playing for the state championship on the highest level of Texas football. This is a winning tribute to a courageous band of underdogs from a time when America desperately needed fresh hope and big dreams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mighty Mites remain a notable moment in the long history of American sports. Just as significant is the depth of the inspirational message. This is a profound lesson in fighting back and clinging to faith. The real winners in Texas high school football were not the kids from the biggest schools, or the ones wearing the most expensive uniforms. They were the scrawny kids from a tiny orphanage who wore scarred helmets and faded jerseys that did not match, kids coached by a devoted man who lived on peanuts and drove them around in a smoke-belching old truck. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In writing a story of unforgettable characters and great football, Jim Dent has come forward to reclaim his place as one of the top sports authors in America today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A remarkable and inspirational story of an orphanage and the man who created one of the greatest football teams Texas has ever known . . . this is their story--the original Friday Night Lights.&nbsp;"This just might be the best sports book ever written. Jim Dent has crafted a story that will go down as one of the most artistic, one of the most unforgettable, and one of the most inspirational ever. <i>Twelve Mighty Orphans</i> will challenge <i>Hoosiers</i> as the feel-good sports story of our lifetime. Naturally, being from Texas, I am biased. Hooray for the Mighty Mites.''<br>--Verne Lundquist, CBS Sports <br>&nbsp;<br>"Coach Rusty Russell and the Mighty Mites will steal your heart as they overcome every obstacle imaginable to become a respected football team. Take an orphanage, the Depression, and mix it with Texas high school football, and Jim Dent has authored another winner, this one about the ultimate underdog.'' <br>--Brent Musburger, ABC Sports/ESPN<br>&nbsp;<br>"No state has a roll call of legendary high school football stories like we do in Texas, and, admittedly, some of those stories have been 'expanded' over the years when it comes to the truth. But let Jim Dent tell you about the Mighty Mites of Masonic Home, the pride of Fort Worth in the dark days of the Depression. Read this book. You will think it's fiction. You will think it's a Hollywood script. But <i>Twelve Mighty Orphans</i> is the truth, and nothing but. It is powerful stuff. Some eighty years later, the Mighty Mites' story remains so sacred, not even a Texan would dare tamper with these facts. And Jim Dent tells it like it was."<br>-- Randy Galloway, columnist, Fort-Worth Star Telegram</p><p>Jim Dent, a longtime award-winning journalist who covered the Dallas Cowboys for eleven years in Fort Worth and Dallas, including a stint at the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram,</i> has written six books, including <i>The Junction Boys,</i> the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that was the basis for an ESPN movie and remains a fan favorite. Dent lives in Nevada.Twelve Mighty Orphans<br><i>Chapter 1</i>BOOTLEGGER'S SONSUMMER 1928&nbsp;<br>From the front porch of the farmhouse near Kirkland, Maggie Ann Brown spotted the barefoot boy running from over a quarter mile away. His feet lifted small clouds of dust and his face showed the strain of his effort. Maggie Ann could not remember seeing her four-year-old run that fast.Little Hardy Brown's arms and legs were like miniature pistons. As he moved closer, Maggie Ann could see that he was mouthing words she could not hear. There was no telling how far he had come, or what he had seen, for the boy was a rambler and might wander the farmland all day, or fish the local creek until the rust-colored sun melted into the horizon.Out in far West Texas, just south of the Panhandle, the land is covered in cotton and wheat and the grain elevators rise up like Greek temples. So flat are the plains that a silo some ten miles away seems to be sitting on your neighbor's property. In the early summer, when the north wind gives up and the sun's furnace kicks on, the ground starts to fracture and turkey buzzards take a rest. That July afternoon of 1928 was a scorcher, and Maggie Ann knew it was not advisable for any child to be working that hard."Slow down, Hardy!" she yelled. "You're going to bust a gut."The boy darted through the front yard and his right foot kicked aside a tricycle. There was an assortment of children's toys strewn across the bare ground, along with a tire iron and a rusted tractor engine.It was a typical shotgun farmhouse with a long, narrow hallway down the middle. "Shotgun" because, if you fired a shotgun from thefront door, the shot would travel down the hall and straight out the backdoor. The place once belonged to a farmer, but a few years earlier he had gotten other ideas. The economy of Childress County was now booming, thanks to an abundance of cotton and wheat. Folks, in spite of Prohibition, were ready to party. So Hardy Brown Sr. decided to lay down his plow and crank up the whiskey still.Stills, in fact.So much potato whiskey was cooked up on the Brown's ten acres that a twenty-four-hour guard was hired to keep the thirsty neighbors at bay. The sheriff of Childress County looked the other way as he pocketed his share, and the operation ran as smoothly as the old cotton gin out on the main highway.Hardy Brown Sr. was a tall, dark-skinned man with thick sideburns that made his face look menacing. They said he had a lot of Comanche in his blood. The warring Comanches had ruled West Texas until the U.S. Army crushed them in the Red River War of 1874. Brown was thick with muscle and could lift a truck off the ground by laying on his back and leg-pressing it, and he did not mind letting people know that he would kick their dog asses if they decided to cross him.This bootlegger was actually two people. There was also the happy family man who played with his kids and took them fishing. He had grown especially fond of Hardy Jr., the baby in the family, who feared nothing and was always into something.Besides being the good father, Brown was also a fornicator and a fighter and a wild bull rider. Saturday nights in Childress, hundreds of people gathered to watch the men fistfight for fun on the town square. The local dairy owner would challenge the hardware salesman and they would duke it out until one fighter determined the other had the advantage. In the end, the two men would shake hands and go back to being friends and neighbors.Few people wanted to tangle with Hardy Brown. Unlike the others, he did not view the event as "sport." The man had killer blood in him. He could throw a pile-driving right hand that would send you to the hospital, or worse. The toughest hombres in the county had stoppedaccepting his challenges on Saturday night. So, he would simply wade into the crowd and start swinging.It was little wonder that his rivals hated him. Whiskey money had transformed the laid-back cotton farmer into the biggest bootlegger between Fort Worth and Amarillo. He loved the fact that he ruled the world of outlaw whiskey. The once quiet county was now swarming with angry family clans. At the height of Prohibition, and just ahead of the Great Depression, the business of bootlegging had erupted like a West Texas gusher. The clans battled each other every day for money, turf, and moonshine. Highway 287 was a Texas version of Thunder Road. Whiskey stills around Kirkland were as prevalent as red dirt, the product as precious as a kiss from a Wichita Falls debutante.Naturally, the hard-charging, stone-fisted Hardy Brown became the most despised man in the county. Driving Highway 287 between Childress and Kirkland one afternoon, he realized that a green Packard was trying to run him off the road. Never one to dodge a confrontation, he steered to the side as two men jumped out of their car. Brown did not reach for a gun or a knife or even a billy club from the backseat. He pulled out a singletree.A singletree was like a long baseball bat with a hook on the end. The device was primarily used to hitch two plow mules together for the purpose of keeping them side-by-side. The first attacker did not see the blow coming. Brown swung the long club and watched the hook sink into the man's skull. The second man tried to flee, but Brown pursued him, hacking away skin and clothing until he pleaded for mercy. He was left to suffer in a pool of blood.As he drove away that day, Brown knew that a bounty would soon be on his head; men would come calling with killing on their minds.A few days later, while walking along a country road with his four-year-old son, Hardy Sr. did not see the Gossett brothers step off the front porch and sneak up behind him with sawed-off shotguns. The twin blasts catapulted the unarmed man more than ten feet as a chunk of ribs and most of his spine were blown away. Little Hardy took off running and did not stop until he reached the family's farmhousesome two miles away. Maggie Brown, now standing on the front porch, felt almost paralyzed when she saw the fear in her son's eyes."Mama, they killed Daddy!""Where?""Up the road?""Who killed Daddy?""Them Gossett men.""How did they kill him?""Shot him in the back. Both of them."Maggie Ann was now in a panic. She dashed into her bedroom and inexplicably started pulling on stockings. She quickly put on a cotton dress and a pair of leather shoes and stashed some belongings in a cloth sack. Upon reaching the front door, she turned to her four children."Mama will be back just as soon as she can," she said. "I promise."Maggie Ann took off running down the dirt road the opposite direction that Hardy had come. Every few steps one of her dress shoes flew off, and she finally tucked it under her arm and kept going. Her stockings split and now her exposed right foot was plastered with dust."Where is Mama going?" little Hardy said."She's going to the train station," his older sister Katherine said. "She's getting out of this place.""Why?""She's scared of them Gossett men."&nbsp;<br>IN THE DAYS ahead, the four Brown kids lived in constant fear of the Gossett brothers. Jeff, Rebe, Katherine, and Hardy slept together in the same bed every night with the covers pulled over their heads.Mona, the oldest sibling in the family, who had married a few years earlier, tried to bring some comfort to the family. She returned to the house where she had grown up and was accompanied by her husband, Spurgeon Clark, who had been a business partner of Hardy Sr. Mona had some news."Fortunately, our daddy was a Master Mason in the local lodge andhis dues were paid up. That qualifies all four of you to go to the Masonic Home down in Fort Worth. It's an orphanage, you know. But I hear that it's a pretty good place. Most of all, you will be safe there."Katherine began to cry. "I don't want to go," she said. "My friends are here. And we've got three cats and two dogs, and who's going to take care of them.""I will," Mona said. "You've got more important things to worry about, like getting an education. You will get some learning at the Home."Jeff cleared his throat. "When is Mama coming back?""From the way she ran out of here, never. I don't think we'll ever see her again in Childress County.""Doesn't she love us anymore?" Katherine said."I haven't talked to her and I don't know where she is. But I'm sure she still loves you."Hardy Brown Sr.'s body was deposited into a pine box three days later and he was buried in an unmarked grave.Not long after the funeral, a picture on the front page of the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i> showed hundreds of trucks and cars parked about the town square of Kirkland. The caption read, "Cotton Money Comes to Town." A little farther down the page, a headline blared, FARMER SLAIN NEAR CHILDRESS.The whole county was buzzing.The Gossett brothers were arrested in a timely manner and then released on bond. George H. Gossett was the first to be tried in Childress County, and the result was a hung jury. Some said you could not find a single citizen in Childress County brave enough to convict a Gossett.George H. Gossett's next trial was moved to Donley in Clarendon County, and a change of venue sent his brother, Howard Gossett, to nearby Memphis, Texas. Both trials were to set to begin the next month.When George H. Gossett's trial ended in a hung jury, Spurgeon Clark decided to take matters into his own hands. More than just an in-law, he had also been a close friend and a loyal partner of HardyBrown's. The two had been inseparable at times, and some folks thought they were brothers.One day, Clark drove to the Brown farmhouse and picked up little Hardy."Where are we going?" the boy said."To take care of some business."Late that afternoon, a man wielding a double-barreled shotgun kicked down the front door of the Gossett farmhouse. A four-year-old boy was by his side. The Gossett brothers tried to escape and Spurgeon Clark blew them away. Moments later, Spurgeon and Hardy stood over the men to make sure they were dead. Spurgeon wanted the young child to know that justice had been served--Texas style."Those were your daddy's killers.""I know."It was a story that both Jeff and Hardy Brown would tell for years. Naturally, it was a chapter in their lives that would haunt them forever.The next Wednesday, the Southern Pacific train pulled into the station in Childress. The four Brown children stepped off the platform into a new world. They knew they would never see their daddy again.They were not sure about their mother.&nbsp;<br>AFTER A LONG and arduous train ride to Fort Worth, four kids with sad and dirty faces stood outside the fence of the orphanage and watched kids playing in the bright sunshine.Footballs sailed high against a hard blue sky.Hardy Brown looked at his brother, Jeff, and said, "I ain't never seen anything like it."Eight-year-old Jeff Brown watched the chaos on the playground. "They played baseball at my elementary school. But I've never seen a ball shaped like that one."As the gate swung open, Hardy Brown took off running and there was nothing the Brown kids could do to stop him. He ran straight toward a football and kicked it for more than twenty yards. Whereupon he was smacked in the mouth with a hard right uppercut. In no time,Jeff Brown had the assailant on the ground, rapping his head with hard knuckles as the boy yelled, "Get off of me, new kid. New kids aren't supposed to be fighting.""How'd you know I was a new kid?" Jeff said."Because you got shoes on. We don't wear shoes around here till October."Jeff shucked his scarred leather shoes to reveal dirty, sockless feet."Now let's fight," he said."I don't want to fight you.""Why not?""Because you look mean.""In that case, keep your dirty hands off my kid brother."Little Hardy puttered down the field and retrieved the football. Tucking it under his arm, he took off in the other direction. No one said a word.Jeff Brown thumbed his chest. "We'll do whatever we feel like doing around here for as long as we feel like doing it."Like his brother, Hardy Brown wore scarred leather shoes and overalls. There was virtually no hair on his head and the sides of his head looked like a peeled onion. Jeff Brown had yet to grow into his big ears, and his hard, angular face would have given the appearance of a boy much older, if not for the splotch of red freckles. Katherine Brown's hair was dark and curly and her skin was darker than the others. She was a year younger than Rebe, who had just turned thirteen and did not seem to comprehend much of anything. One of his eyes had been badly damaged in a fight and made a sharp right turn. His mouth was slightly agape and every few seconds he gulped the air with a loud snort.For the last thirty seconds, a tall man in his twenties had been half-trotting for more than a hundred yards to reach the Brown kids. He was barrel-chested, with thick hands."That kid," he said, pointing at Rebe. "That kid looks retarded. What the hell happened to that boy's eye?""Went through a meat grinder," Jeff said. "Now, mister, you leave my brother alone.""Son, you apparently don't know who I am. I am the dean of the little boys. You'll be answering to me for many years. You refer to me as Mr. Wynn.""Well, Mr. Wynn, it's nice to meet you," Jeff said. "But you leave ol' Rebe here be."With one hand, Big Frank Wynn grabbed Jeff Brown's hair, and with the other pulled a rubber hose from his back pocket. He spun the boy around and whacked him on the butt."One, two, three, four, five," he counted. "How many more do you want, boy?"Orphans crowded around to watch. They waited for the tears to bubble up in the new kid's eyes. But nothing changed in his expression and, instead of crying, Jeff Brown burst into laughter. Wynn spun the boy around again and whipped him five more times.Nothing seemed to faze him. The boy was still laughing and soaking up the attention from his fellow orphans when the dean kicked him in the backside and yelled, "Get your butt up that hill to the dormitory. And you can forget about your supper tonight."TWELVE MIGHTY ORPHANS. Copyright � 2007 by Jim Dent. All rights reserved.

He is also the co-author of the bestselling nonfiction work <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i>. He lives with his wife and three children in Hertfordshire, England.<i>Chapter One</i><br>ON A SPRING DAY in his twelfth year, Temujin raced his four brothers across the steppes, in the shadow of the mountain known as Deli&#x2019;un-Boldakh. The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path. As the brothers raced across the plains under a spring sun, there was no finishing line, as there would be at the great gathering of tribes. Even if there had been, it was too soon after winter to really push their mounts. They all knew better than to exhaust the ponies before they had a little summer fat and good green grass in their bellies. This was a race away from chores and responsibilities, and it would leave them with nothing but arguments about who had cheated, or should have won. Bekter rode almost upright, so that he seemed peculiarly motionless as the horse galloped under him. It was an illusion, Temujin knew. Bekter&#x2019;s hands on the reins were guiding subtly, and his gray mare was fresh and strong. He would take some beating. Temujin rode as Khasar did, low on the saddle, so that he was practically flat against the horse&#x2019;s neck. The wind seemed to sting a little more and both boys preferred the position.<br><br>Temujin sensed Khasar moving up on his right shoulder. He urged the last breath of speed from Whitefoot, and the little pony snorted with something like anger as it galloped. Temujin could see Khasar&#x2019;s pony out of the corner of his eye, and he considered veering slightly, as if by accident. Khasar seemed to sense his intention and lost a length as he moved away, leaving Temujin grinning. They knew each other too well to race, he sometimes thought. He could see Bekter glance back and their eyes met for a second. Temujin raised his eyebrows and showed his teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;I am coming,&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Try to stop me!&#x201d;<br><br>Bekter turned his back on him, stiff with dislike. It was something of a rarity to have Bekter come riding with them, but as he was there, Temujin could see he was determined to show the &#x201c;children&#x201d; how a warrior could ride. He would not take a loss easily, which was why Temujin would strain every muscle and sinew to beat him. Khasar had gained on both of them, and before Temujin could move to block him, he had almost drawn level. The two boys smiled at each other, confirming that they shared the joy of the day and the speed. The long, dark winter was behind, and though it would come back too soon, they would have this time and take pleasure in it. There was no better way to live. The tribe would eat fat mutton and the herds would birth more sheep and goats for food and trade. The evenings would be spent fletching arrows or braiding horsetails into twine; in song or listening to stories and the history of the tribes. Yesugei would ride against any young Tartars who raided their herds, and the tribe would move lightly on the plains, from river to river. There would be work, but in summer the days were long enough to give hours free to waste, a luxury they never seemed to find in the cold months. What was the point in wandering away to explore when a wild dog might find and bite you in the night? That had happened to Temujin when he was only a little older than Kachiun, and the fear had stayed with him.<br><br>It was Khasar who saw that Temuge had fallen, glancing back in case Kachiun was staging a late rush for the grass crown. Khasar claimed to have the sharpest eyes of the tribe, and he saw that the sprawled speck was not moving, making a decision in an instant. He whistled high-low to Bekter and Temujin, letting them know he was pulling out. Both boys looked back and then farther to where Temuge lay in a still heap. Temujin and his older brother shared a moment of indecision, neither willing to give the race to the other. Bekter shrugged as if it did not matter and reined his mare into a wide circle back the way they had come. Temujin matched him exactly and they galloped as a pair behind the others, the leaders become the led. It was Kachiun now who rode first amongst them, though Temujin doubted the boy even thought of it. At eight, Kachiun was closest in age to Temuge and had spent many long evenings teaching him the names of things in the gers, demonstrating an unusual patience and kindness. Perhaps as a result, Temuge spoke better than many boys of his age, though he was hopeless with the knots Kachiun&#x2019;s quick fingers tried to show him. The youngest of Yesugei&#x2019;s sons was clumsy, and if any of them had been asked to guess at the identity of a fallen rider, they would have said &#x201c;Temuge&#x201d; without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation.<br><br>Temujin jumped from his saddle as he reached the others. Kachiun was already on the ground with Khasar, lifting the supine Temuge into a sitting position.<br><br>The little boy&#x2019;s face was very pale and bruised-looking. Kachiun slapped him gently, wincing as Temuge&#x2019;s head lolled.<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, little man,&#x201d; Kachiun told his brother, but there was no response. Temujin&#x2019;s shadow fell across them and Kachiun deferred to him immediately.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see him fall,&#x201d; he said, as if his seeing would have helped. Temujin nodded, his deft hands feeling Temuge for broken bones or signs of a wound. There was a lump on the side of his head, hidden by the black hair. Temujin prodded at it.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s knocked out, but I can&#x2019;t feel a break. Give me a little water for him.&#x201d;<br><br>He held out a hand and Khasar pulled a leather bottle from a saddlecloth, drawing the stopper with his teeth. Temujin dribbled the warm liquid into Temuge&#x2019;s open mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t choke him,&#x201d; Bekter advised, reminding them he was still mounted, as if he supervised the others.<br><br>Temujin didn&#x2019;t trouble to reply. He was filled with dread as to what their mother Hoelun would say if Temuge died. They could hardly give her such news while her belly was filled with another child. She was weak from sickness and Temujin thought the shock and grief might kill her, yet how could they hide it? She doted on Temuge and her habit of feeding him the sweet yoghurt curds was part of the reason for his chubby flesh.<br><br>Without warning, Temuge choked and spat water. Bekter made an irritable sound with his lips, tired of the children&#x2019;s games. The rest of them beamed at each other.<br><br>&#x201c;I dreamed of the eagle,&#x201d; Temuge said.<br><br>Temujin nodded at him. &#x201c;That is a good dream,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you must learn to ride, little man.

At its peak it governed a quarter of the world&#39;s land and people and dominated all its seas. Though little now remains of the Empire as a political power, its legacy is all around us. It laid the foundation for the global triumph of capitalism. It gave the world its common language, English. It exported both Protestantism and parliaments. And it defeated a succession of rival empires from the Habsburgs&#39; to Hitler&#39;s. In the 21st century another English-speaking superpower seems to bestride the globe. But today&#39;s American empire was yesterday&#39;s British colony. For better and for worse, the world we now know is in large measure the product of Britain&#39;s Age of Empire. How did a rainy island in the North Atlantic manage to achieve all this? What were the special factors that enabled Britain to make the modern world - and made the modern world so British? These are the crucial questions addressed by Niall Ferguson in &#34;Empire&#34;. This was the first age of globalization. But it was, says Ferguson, globalization with gunboats. This text shows how the British wrested power from their rivals by a combination of imitation and intimidation. It shows how mass migration from Britain turned the American and Australian continents white - and how the missionary movement sought to enlighten the &#34;dark&#34; continents of Africa and Asia. Above all, &#34;Empire&#34; explains how the British Empire rose - and why it finally fell. Ferguson&#39;s answers are controversial but compelling.</p><p>At its peak in the nineteenth century, the British Empire was the largest empire ever known, governing roughly a quarter of the world's population. In <i>Empire</i>, Niall Ferguson explains how "an archipelago of rainy islands... came to rule the world," and examines the costs and consequences, both good and bad, of British imperialism. Though the book's breadth is impressive, it is not intended to be a comprehensive history of the British Empire; rather, Ferguson seeks to glean lessons from this history for future, or present, empires--namely America. Pointing out that the U.S. is both a product of the British Empire as well as an heir to it, he asks whether America--an "empire in denial"--should "seek to shed or to shoulder the imperial load it has inherited." As he points out in this fascinating book, there is compelling evidence for both. <p> Observing that "the difficulty with the achievements of empire is that they are much more likely to be taken for granted than the sins of empire," Ferguson stresses that the British did do much good for humanity in their quest for domination: promotion of the free movement of goods, capital, and labor and a common rule of law and governance chief among them. "The question is not whether British imperialism was without blemish. It was not. The question is whether there could have been a less bloody path to modernity," he writes. The challenge for the U.S., he argues, is for it to use its undisputed power as a force for positive change in the world and not to fall into some of the same traps as the British before them. </p> <p> Covering a wide range of topics, including the rise of consumerism (initially fueled by a desire for coffee, tea, tobacco, and sugar), the biggest mass migration in history (20 million emigrants between the early 1600s and the 1950s), the impact of missionaries, the triumph of capitalism, the spread of the English language, and globalization, this is a brilliant synthesis of various topics and an extremely entertaining read. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Niall Ferguson is one of Britain&#39;s most renowned historians.

The plan leads his son, "Milkman"--a named he earned after his mother nursed him well past the proper age--onto a path exactly opposite the one his father had hoped. Milkman is driven into the arms of a violent, lower-class woman, into a clandestine circle of blacks who repay white violence in kind and into an awareness that he can fulfill his own potential by understanding the mistakes of his ancestors as they relate to his own."A stunningly beautiful book . . . I would call the book poetry, but that would seem to be denying its considerable power as a story.

Meet Mark and Jeremy: two very ordinary weirdos. Mark, a middle-aged man trapped in a twentysomething's body, is the sensible one&#x2014;a loan manager with seven GCSEs ("back when a GCSE actually meant something") and an unhealthy obsession with World War II. His flatmate, Jeremy, is a grade-A work-shy freeloader with&nbsp;sketchy fruebds. He dreams of being a world-class musician but can't seem to get out of bed in the morning.

The moonlit tour continues on to the Rocky Mountains, the Everglades and the Malaysian jungle, rumbling with the majestic roar of the Indo-Chinese tiger. This wonderful nighttime adventure makes an educational and entertaining bedtime book.</p><p><b>Maurice Pledger</b> is an internationally-acclaimed artist known best for his realistic and detailed illustrations of animals and wildlife.

Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of the The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systems. Arthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that "It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance." Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with "built-in" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text. After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations. This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities. Virtually all of the members of the TASC technical staff have, at one time and in one way or another, contributed to the material contained in the work</p></p><p></p><h2>Printing by Hand: A Modern Guide to Printing with Handmade Stamps, Stencils, and Silk Screens</h2><p>It&#x2019;s the natural inconsistencies&#x2015;the accidental differences between one finished piece and another&#x2015;that make hand-printed fabrics, papers, furniture, and works of art so interesting. The quirks are what show the maker&#x2019;s intimate involvement in the process, and it&#x2019;s that unique quality that first attracted textile designer and illustrator Lena Corwin to hand-printing.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>Even though decorative prints are more in vogue than ever, there was until now no up-to-date hand-printing guide&#x2015;no single source explaining the tools and materials that are used today, or reflecting a contemporary aesthetic. Corwin has given us that guide.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>Using step-by-step instructions and up-close photos, Corwin teaches crafters everything they need to know to master stamping, stenciling, and screen printing, from making their own printing devices to trouble-shooting when plans go awry. Her inimitable collection of projects ranges from stamped stationery and simple-to-sew pouches, to stenciled tote bags and furniture, to screen-printed bed linens and upholstery fabric. There&#x2019;s even a silk-screened dog bed. The author has created original artwork for each project (full-size patterns are included in an envelope at the back of the book), so that every crafter can achieve the same beautiful results. Or maybe not quite the same. Remember: It&#x2019;s the subtle differences that make hand-printing so special and alluring.<p></p></p><p>Lena Corwin is a textile designer and illustrator based in Brooklyn.

The quest takes Syaoran&#x2019;s odd bunch to a jungle world where helpless creatures are being terrorized by a sacrifice-demanding beast.

A suspense story can be every bit as well-wrought as any other, argues Patricia Highsmith in <i>Plotting and Writing Suspense Fiction</i>. To show how, Highsmith focuses as much on her failures as on her successes. Amid discussions about growing ideas, story development, plotting, first and second drafts, and revisions are anecdotes from Highsmith's own career. Highsmith (<i>Strangers on a Train</i>) admits to editing with crayon (doing so "gives one the proper cavalier attitude"), napping on the job (it helps solve problems), and having written one "really dull" book. Though this book is slim, there are some lovely thoughts on such issues as creating a murderer-hero with "pleasant qualities," "stretch[ing] the reader's credulity," and using "as much care in depicting the face and appearance of ... main characters" as a painter would with a portrait. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995) was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and moved to New York when she was six, where she attended the Julia Richman High School and Barnard College. In her senior year she edited the college magazine, having decided at the age of sixteen to become a writer. Her first novel, Strangers on a Train, was made into a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. The Talented Mr Ripley, published in 1955, introduced the fascinating anti-hero Tom Ripley, and was made into an Oscar-winning film in 1999 by Anthony Minghella. Graham Greene called Patricia Highsmith &#39;the poet of apprehension&#39;, saying that she &#39;created a world of her own - a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger&#39; and The Times named her no.1 in their list of the greatest ever crime writers. Patricia Highsmith died in Locarno, Switzerland, in February 1995. Her last novel, Small g: A Summer Idyll, was published posthumously, the same year.</p><h2>The Inside Story (The Sisters Grimm, Book 8)</h2><p>After the shocking ending of <i>The Everafter War,</i> this book, the penultimate one in the series, picks up with Sabrina, Daphne, and Puck stuck in the Book of Everafter, where all the fairy tales are stored and enchanted characters can change their destinies.

It is definitely not love at first sight, but as it turns out, obnoxious Kristy's pushy management style is just what's needed to make a fat second baseman go on a diet, cure a catcher afraid to catch, wake up a fielder who sleeps on the job, and bring the team into the play-offs. With plenty of obvious misguided psychologizing and Three Stooges-style antics, this freewheeling baseball yarn is laugh-out-loud funny from first page to last. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Never a Dull Moment: 1971 The Year That Rock Exploded</h2><p><p><b>**One of Amazon's Best Books of 2016: Top 100 Editors' Picks**</b></p><p>A rollicking look at 1971, rock&#x2019;s golden year, the year that saw the release of the indelible recordings of Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, the Who, Rod Stewart, Carole King, the Rolling Stones, and others and produced more classics than any other year in rock history</p><p>The Sixties ended a year late.

Since Keith Richards&#x2019;s <em>Life</em> appeared in 2010 (and set the standard for rock books, by the way), a torrent of biographies, memoirs, and retrospectives have followed in its wake. Many have been excellent-- <em>Trouble Boys</em>, <em>Kill &#x2018;Em and Leave</em>, and <em>The Sun and the Moon and the Rolling Stones</em> are just three recent examples, and <em>Never a Dull Moment: 1971: The Year That Rock Exploded</em> by the venerable music journalist David Hepworth continues the hot streak. Hepworth, who was 21 years old in the year of his title, pulls together 12 months of events that closed the Age of Pop (i.e. The Beatles) and ushered in the Age of Rock, with its shift to album sales (vs. singles), arena acts, and erosion of race- and gender-based cultural boundaries. Rather than a fawning run-down of the usual 70s acts&#x2014;though he does range from Carole King and the Carpenters to Zeppelin and the Stones to Marvin Gaye and Sly and the Family Stone, and more--<em>NADM</em> takes the high-altitude view, blending together seemingly disparate elements such as boomer demographics, feminism, emerging technologies, and the apparent ubiquity of hot pants to recreate the seismic events of the year that shaped the entertainment industry's next decade (or three).

She was the author of The Stones of Florence and Birds of America, among other books.Those who read Brightman's NBCC-winning biography Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World will remember the snippets of this correspondence as one of the highlights. Wise, eloquent and loving, the letters chronicled a quarter-century friendship between two women of widely differing backgrounds united by respect and a shared contempt for intellectual fraud. Their characters and their circumstances made for a rich exchange: Based in Europe, the American writer McCarthy (1912-1989) gave the German-born political philosopher Arendt (1906-1975) an earpiece into Europe, while Arendt, based in New York City and Chicago, served a similar function for McCarthy. McCarthy's carefully constructed, wonderfully perceptive letters and Arendt's more studious replies return time and again to moral philosophy, politics and shared friends (including many of the intellectuals of the time). But the letters are also models of the fine art of constructive criticism and the role of friendship. "Workmanly friendship," as McCarthy says, describing Arendt's Men in Dark Times, "of apprentices starting out with their bundle on a pole and doing a piece of the road together." That their bundle included a half-dozen important books and their road was an uneven one of critical kudos, unfavorable reviews, the popular success of McCarthy's The Group and the intellectual furor over Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem should not obscure the warmth or trueness of this deeply engaging exchange. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Yonie Wondernose</h2><p>A curious Amish boy who lives on the family farm in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, shares a wonderful secret with his father.</p><p></p><h2>Son of the Morning Star</h2><p>A runaway bestseller in hardcover and paperback, Son of the Morning Star will now bring the adventurous tale of General George Armstrong Custer to a new, even wider audience.

Read her review of <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>As Dante&#x2019;s hell is circular, so is Bret Easton Ellis&#x2019;s L.A. Everywhere in <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em> there is a sense of time frozen, time collapsed and time rounding back on itself in various diabolical ways. The novel marks a return to the characters of <em>Less Than Zero</em>, twenty-five years on, where it&#x2019;s still the same old scene, camera flashes and sun-blinded gloss--only this time, there&#x2019;s a persistent echo of unease, the sadness of moving in a young world while no longer young in it. Clay, casting teenagers for his eighties period film, ominously named "The Listeners," finds himself eyeing the sixteen-year-old actors dressed in the style of his youth and thinking they are friends of his, though of course they aren&#x2019;t. His old friend Julian, affable as usual, is rumored to be running a teenage hooker service ("Like old times," as Clay comments acidly), while Rip, he of the trust fund that "might never run out," is in his middle age so disfigured from plastic surgery as to be practically unrecognizable, though he still has the whispery voice of the handsome boy he once was.</p> <p>This is the most Chandleresque of Bret&#x2019;s books, and the most deeply steeped in L.A. noir. No one is trustworthy; everyone is playing everyone else. Moreover, as in all Bret&#x2019;s novels, fiction collides with reality, and fiction with fiction. Clay is being followed, for reasons he comes to suspect may have to do with the girl he&#x2019;s fallen for. There are mysterious texts (from a dead boy? the previous tenant of Clay&#x2019;s apartment?) a message written in red on a bathroom mirror: <em>Disappear here</em>. Running throughout are cocktail-party rumors of vans in the desert, ski masks, chains and mutilations, mass graves, a videotaped execution, though--as will be no surprise to any reader of Bret&#x2019;s books---the rumors aren&#x2019;t entirely rumors, in fact, the truth is rather worse than anything one has imagined. But what stays with one is not so much the concluding note of betrayal and horror as the mournfulness of the book, its eerie sense of stasis: clear skies, vacuum-sealed calm, the BlackBerry flashing on the nightstand in the middle of the night, everywhere the subliminal hum of menace, while the surgically-altered Rip brings his lips close to the ear and whispers in a voice so quiet as to almost be swallowed by the surrounding emptiness: <em>Descansado</em>.

Now in <i>The Fight to Vote, </i>Michael Waldman takes a succinct and comprehensive look at a crucial American struggle: the drive to define and defend government based on &#x201c;the consent of the governed.&#x201d; From the beginning, and at every step along the way, as Americans sought to right to vote, others have fought to stop them. This is the first book to trace the full story from the founders&#x2019; debates to today&#x2019;s challenges: a wave of restrictive voting laws, partisan gerrymanders, the flood of campaign money unleashed by Citizens United. Americans are proud of our democracy. But today that system seems to be under siege, and the right to vote has become the fight to vote.<br> <br>In fact, that fight has always been at the heart of our national story, and raucous debates over how to expand democracy have always been at the center of American politics. At first only a few property owners could vote. Over two centuries, working class white men, former slaves, women, and finally all Americans won the right to vote. The story goes well beyond voting rules to issues of class, race, political parties, and campaign corruption. It's been raw, rowdy, a fierce, and often rollicking struggle for power. Waldman&#x2019;s <i>The Fight to Vote</i> is a compelling story of our struggle to uphold our most fundamental democratic ideals.</p><p>Michael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, a nonpartisan law and policy institute that focuses on improving the systems of democracy and justice. He was director of speechwriting for President Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1999 and is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Fight to Vote</i>,&nbsp;<i>My Fellow Americans</i>,&nbsp;<i>POTUS Speaks</i>, and three other books.

He comments widely in the media on law and policy.The Fight to Vote 1<p></p> &#x201c;The Consent of the Governed&#x201d;<p></p> <br>AT THE start of America&#x2019;s drive toward democracy, many thought about representation and how to give power to the people. Surprisingly few thought about the vote.<br> <br>On June 11, 1776, Philadelphia pulsed with revolution. In quick succession the Continental Congress appointed three committees to prepare for the expected final break with Great Britain. One panel would explore foreign alliances; another would set terms for a confederation of the newly independent states; and the Committee of Five would write the Declaration of Independence. As that document grew in importance over the years, its authors described how it was drafted. The story got better with each retelling. John Adams claimed he had chosen the thirty-three-year-old Thomas Jefferson, just as he had tapped George Washington to lead the Continental Army. &#x201c;You should do it,&#x201d; he remembered insisting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh! no,&#x201d; Jefferson replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why will you not? You ought do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Reasons enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What can be your reasons?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Reason first&#x2014;You are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second&#x2014;I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular.&#x2014;You are much otherwise. Reason third&#x2014;You can write ten times better than I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>Years later Jefferson would serenely deny such a conversation, claiming it was clear all along that he would write the Declaration. In any case, that Jefferson&#x2019;s hand held the quill would have echoing consequences. Adams, after all, was a fussily conservative thinker, fearful of what he called the &#x201c;leveling&#x201d; tendencies of democracy. The Virginian did more than draft a bill of complaints against the British Crown. His draft began with a statement of principle that became an enduring American creed.<br> <br>Working on a portable desk made to order by a local carpenter and attended by a fourteen-year-old slave boy, Bob Hemmings, Jefferson consulted the &#x201c;declaration of rights&#x201d; drafted for the new Virginia constitution. The Pennsylvania Gazette had printed it in full that week. That document, written by George Mason, began by declaring that &#x201c;all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&#x201d; It went on to proclaim that &#x201c;all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jefferson pared, pruned, and reshaped the words into the ringing preamble of America&#x2019;s Declaration. &#x201c;We hold these truths to be self-evident&#x201d;&#x2014;the last phrase Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s felicitous edit&#x2014;&#x201c;that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#x201d; Jefferson&#x2019;s opening salvo evoked the philosophy of natural rights. Historians recently have been scrutinizing the parchment again and have concluded that the passage ended not with a period but a comma, thus driving forward to the next point:<br> <br>&#x2014;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,<br> <br>&#x2014;That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.<br> <br>The &#x201c;consent of the governed&#x201d;&#x2014;consent that must be won from &#x201c;all men,&#x201d; &#x201c;created equal.&#x201d; It was an idea both revolutionary and &#x201c;intended to be an expression of the American mind,&#x201d; as Jefferson put it. This ideal was far from reality at the time it was pronounced in 1776. Young America was anything but a democracy. But the fight to give life to those words was under way, even as Jefferson wrote. That creed would rebuke civic inequality from the beginning. Abolitionists declaimed the preamble in mass meetings in the 1830s. The first women&#x2019;s rights convention, at Seneca Falls, New York, traced its language. Abraham Lincoln, decrying the spread of slavery in 1854, called that passage &#x201c;the sheet anchor of American republicanism.&#x201d; He paraphrased it at Gettysburg. Franklin Roosevelt borrowed it to decry &#x201c;economic royalists&#x201d; during the Depression. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. cited it as &#x201c;the true meaning of [our] creed.&#x201d; Mostly these later Americans focused on its articulation of equality. Less clear, and the basis of two centuries of battle, is the connection between equal citizenship and a government that relies on and is responsible to the people. The power of that idea would impel a movement toward democracy that would take two centuries.<br> &#x201c;No Will of Their Own&#x201d;<p></p> <br>At the time of the Revolution, America was a traditional, stratified society. A small cluster of wealthy men led the revolt: plantation owners like Washington, attorneys like Adams, and merchants like John Hancock. Americans paid deference. The sense of social hierarchy&#x2014;and the idea that political power should flow from that rank&#x2014;was palpable.<br> <br>The colonists inherited political ideas lauding Great Britain&#x2019;s &#x201c;balanced&#x201d; system. That approach split power between the king (&#x201c;the one&#x201d;), the nobles (&#x201c;the few,&#x201d; found in the House of Lords), and the people (&#x201c;the many,&#x201d; represented in the House of Commons). Such a system of checks, balances, and limits would protect liberty&#x2014;the right, above all else, to be left alone by a potentially tyrannical government. In England representation was visibly uneven in the eighteenth century. &#x201c;Rotten boroughs&#x201d; in the countryside elected members of Parliament from just one family&#x2019;s estate. Old Sarum, a verdant but unpopulated mound in rural Salisbury, sent two men to Parliament. In effect some buildings had the right to vote, but not all people. Meanwhile the new industrial cities Manchester and Birmingham went without direct representation. The satirical painter William Hogarth parodied the state of British elections. Colorful images of bribery, drunkenness, and lechery&#x2014;and a mayor passed out from eating too many oysters&#x2014;spill across the canvas.<br> <br>When the colonial agitators and pamphleteers of 1776 spoke of &#x201c;consent of the governed,&#x201d; they echoed the language of the British philosopher John Locke and his notion of the social contract: the idea that rulers and people must forge an agreement for government to be legitimate and that the people had the right to overthrow an unjust state. The colonists weren&#x2019;t thinking about turning out incumbent officeholders, as we might today, but the much more disruptive task of overthrowing a regime. At first these arguments mostly referred not to individuals and the government but to the colonies and the mother country. Conflict first flared over the Stamp Act of 1765. The British had insisted that the colonists be satisfied with &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; representation in Parliament, just as most Englishmen were. Now the American colonists demanded direct representation in the halls of power. Repeated calls for representation and equal rights&#x2014;calls directed by colonial Whig leaders toward England&#x2014;in turn led some within the colonies to ask uncomfortable questions. Religious minorities such as Baptists and Catholics, debtors, and backwoods farmers began to direct similar demands at the governments closer to home.<br> <br>Yet this debate about representation, these first forays toward the ideas of democracy, rarely revolved around voting itself.<br> <br>In the colonies as in England, only white men with a defined amount of property could vote. The restriction dated to the Middle Ages. A British law enacted in 1430 limited voting to only those with a freehold estate producing an annual income of 40 shillings&#x2014;enough to &#x201c;furnish all the necessaries of life, and render the freeholder, if he pleased, an independent man.&#x201d; Colonists solemnly rehashed the arguments for voting limits: only men with a stake in society could be trusted with the franchise. Not just African slaves but indentured servants, tenant farmers, women, children, indebted artisans&#x2014;many found themselves dependent on someone else. William Blackstone was an English jurist whose influential lectures landed in Boston and Philadelphia bookstores just a few years before the Revolution. The property limit on voting, Blackstone explained, seeks &#x201c;to exclude such persons as are in so mean a situation that they are esteemed to have no will of their own.&#x201d; Poor people would be &#x201c;tempted to dispose&#x201d; of their votes&#x2014;literally, to sell them. &#x201c;This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in elections than is consistent with general liberty.&#x201d; Excluding the poor, he insisted, would actually foster greater equality among the remaining voters. His arguments echo in later claims that the poor are duped, easily induced to fraud, somehow shady&#x2014;and the assertion that blocking their vote would actually help them. Even then this must have seemed something of a stretch. Palpable fears lingered not far below the surface. Give everyone a vote, and who knows what they will vote for?<br> <br>Just how limited was the right to vote at the time of the American Revolution? Historians can&#x2019;t quite agree. The thirteen colonies were independent of one another and had varying rules. Seven restricted voting to men who owned land with specific acreage or value, others to those with specific amounts of personal property. One summary suggests that &#x201c;by and large the property clauses prohibited at least a quarter&#x2014;and in some states possibly as many of half&#x2014;of the white male adults from voting for representatives to their state legislatures.&#x201d; In newly settled areas inland, cheap land meant wider ownership. There as many as 80 percent of white men could vote. But in established areas and cities that hugged the Atlantic coastline only 40 percent of white men could cast ballots. One historian claimed colonial Massachusetts was a &#x201c;middle class democracy.&#x201d; Yet women were prohibited from voting almost everywhere; in most colonies so were Catholics and free black men. And of course neither slaves nor Indians could vote. Of the 3 million people who lived in the thirteen colonies, only a fraction could cast ballots.<br> <br>In any event, before the Revolution voting did not matter much. Royal appointees made the big decisions about taxes, appointments, and whether to take military action. Legislatures were a check on distant executive power, not the source of legitimate public authority. The sovereign was, well, sovereign. Elections were infrequent. In a brief ritualized moment of equality, members of the gentry would stoop to mingle with the public and seek support. Crowds would gather, eager to see the candidates and their families arrive by fancy coach. Office seekers would host f�tes for voters, with ample hard cider and food. Colonists called it &#x201c;treating.&#x201d; When young George Washington ran for office in Virginia in 1755, Daniel Okrent writes, &#x201c;he attributed his defeat to his failure to provide enough alcohol for the voters. When he tried again two years later, Washington floated into office partly on the 144 gallons of rum, punch, hard cider and beer his election agent handed out&#x2014;roughly half a gallon for every vote he received.&#x201d; He gently chided his campaign agent, &#x201c;My only fear is that you spent with too sparing a hand.&#x201d; Politicians called it &#x201c;swilling the planters with bumbo.&#x201d; Another, younger Virginia office seeker was more fastidious. James Madison disdained &#x201c;personal solicitation&#x201d; of voters and &#x201c;the corrupting influence of spirituous liquors, and other treats.&#x201d; Madison lost. Voting was generally done viva voce (by voice). Sometimes it was done &#x201c;by view,&#x201d; with supporters lining up to stand behind candidates. Enthusiasts with clubs would drive off their opponents&#x2019; backers. Paying for votes was so common in one small colony, it became known as &#x201c;Rhode Islandism.&#x201d; Polling places across the colonies were scattered, sometimes a full day&#x2019;s ride from where voters lived. Elections were marred by bribery and intimidation.<br> <br>As a result few people voted, even when they had the right to do so. In a Connecticut gubernatorial election after Independence, only 5 percent of eligible voters turned out. One clergyman bemoaned the apathy. The &#x201c;multitude,&#x201d; he complained, &#x201c;will not leave the plow to have a governor of their taste.&#x201d; Of course poor people might be enraged or engaged for a brief time by a public issue. If they could not vote, they could engage in &#x201c;mobbing&#x201d;&#x2014;burning an official in effigy, say, or enthusiastically rioting. The roughnecks organized by Sam Adams in his protests against British policy&#x2014;throwing stones as they whooped &#x201c;Liberty and Property!&#x201d;&#x2014;were making their voices heard (loudly) in a manner quite familiar to their countrymen.<br> <br>That was America on the eve of the Revolution. A world of deference and disinterest, where a few great families were presumed to govern. In The Radicalism of the American Revolution, the historian Gordon S. Wood traces what happened next, how the ideas held by the colonists began to shift&#x2014;rapidly, vertiginously. They thought they could replace monarchy with a republic, in which a few dispassionate men would hold power. Virtue would govern. They erected a new edifice of government that would enable those men to sift through society&#x2019;s competing demands. The Constitution, with its checks and balances, its tentative nods to democracy and its multiple veto points, embodied their theories. The founders discovered they had set loose political and intellectual energies that quickly overwhelmed those dreams and ideas.<br> &#x201c;The Influence and Control of the People&#x201d;<p></p> <br>In January 1776 word arrived: King George III had rejected the &#x201c;olive branch petition&#x201d; sent by the Continental Congress the previous summer, refusing even to read it, denouncing those in the colonies who &#x201c;openly avow their revolt, hostility, and rebellion,&#x201d; and vowing &#x201c;the most decisive exertions&#x201d; of military force to quell the uprising. The very day the Royal Address was printed in Philadelphia, Thomas Paine published Common Sense. Paine had arrived in the New World just two years before, escaping a failed marriage and a desultory career as a rope maker and tax collector in England. His pamphlet proved a sensation, a wild and widely bootlegged best seller with 150,000 copies in print. Paine argued for a break not just with Britain but with monarchy itself. &#x201c;England since the conquest hath known some few good monarchs, but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones,&#x201d; he wrote.

An 18-month world trip set him up for a career in travel writing, via the scenic route of bookselling. After ten years at Lonely Planet and Holiday Which? magazine, he decamped to Switzerland, where he is currently manager of the Stauffacher English Bookshop in Bern. As well as grappling with German, re-learning to cross the road properly, and overcoming his innate desire to form an orderly queue, he has spent the last four years exploring the bits of the country he&#39;d never heard of before and eating lots of chocolate.We all know that Switzerland gave us the world of cuckoo clocks, triangular chocolate and penknives, but how about the Toilet Duck, Velcro and LSD?

It is the distillation of what the Pardey&#39;s have learned in 150,000 miles of sailing on board their two cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin, and on scores of other boats they have delivered or raced. Lin and Larry tell how they have sailed in comfort and safety without large cash outlay- on a pay-as-you-earn-as-you-go plan and by simplifying.In its first edition, this invaluable text has seen nine reprints. Now Lin and Larry have updated and revised the information to make it current and a valuable edition to any sailor&#39;s library right up to the millennium.</p><p>Lin and Larry Pardey have voyaged together for over 26 years, covering the equivalent of 5 circumnavigations on board their own self-built cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin. Larry worked as first mate on a 140-ton, 85-foot schooner, Double Eagle, voyaging from Newport Beach, California, to Hawaii and back and along the Mexican coast before meeting Lin. He, along with Leslie Dyball, won the handicap prize for first overall in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race. Lin and Larry have delivered two dozen boats across oceans and raced their own and others boats. Their interest in storm tactics has led them to research both older and modern methods of heaving-to, by talking and corresponding with sailors from dozens of countries, by working with Victor Shane at the Drag Device Data Base, and by testing both on their own boat in hurricane-force winds and on modern boats off the Cape of Storms, in South Africa. <p>Larry was selected as the winner of the International Oceanic Award, givenby the Royal Institute of Navigation under the sponsorship of the Little Ship Club of London and presented by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, for the most meritorious voyage of over 2,000 miles using traditional methods of navigation. Larrys award was for 30 years of successful voyaging, covering more than 150,000 miles on 21 different vessels and using onlysextant and chronometer, including his 2,840 mile voyage in 1995 from Fernancdo do Noronha to Horta, in the Azores. </p><p>In March 1996, Lin was presented with the Ocean Cruising Club Award for the person who has done the most to foster and encourage ocean cruising in small craft and the practice of seamanship and navigation in all branches, at the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in London. </p><p>Articles by Lin and Larry have appeared in <i>Sail Magazine</i>, <i>Cruising World</i>, <i>Woodenboat</i> (USA) <i>Practical Boat Owner</i>, <i>Yachting Monthly</i>, <i>Classic Boat Magazine</i> (UK), <i>Cruising Helmsman</i> (Australia), <i>South African Yachting</i>, and <i>Nautica</i> (Brazil). </p><p>Their nine books have been published in both the United States and England; two have been translated into German and Japanese.

Here are some of the comments. <p>"I read Dr. Greer's book. Wow! It is excellent! beautifully written, the book contains a lot of new information about the ET experience worldwide. Dr.. Greer's book should be a must read for every citizen of the world. I have read many of the top UFO books (Timothy Good), but Dr. Greer's is the best book on the subject I've read." B.H. ( former military intelligence). </p><p>"I recently finished Dr. Greer's book 'Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence and Implications". I must say that it is by far the most informative and 'believable' book on the ET subject that I have ever read, and I have read many. I honestly believe that Dr. Greer will be the one person responsible for getting the ET questions answered for the whole world to see." J.D.R. </p><p>"There's a sensational new book that I'm feeling driven to tell everyone about.....The book is Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence and Implications and it is a riveting, scientifically grounded revelation. With every few pages, it seemed to blow my mind. By nature curious, I have no qualms about asking questions, and vague, nebulous, anecdotal UFO/ET accounts don't usually sustain my interest for long. But I was deeply moved by this book, because the material seems rock solid. It is breathtaking, inspiring...and disturbing. The 50 year campaign of disinformation, fear mongering, hoaxes and extra-legal activities by covert managements of this phenomenon has unfortunately been extremely successful and most people are honestly confused and uninformed about what will one day be seen as the most momentous development of the 20th-21st centuries. </p><p>"This book is so good...I am giving this to my adult children as their introduction to the reality of all the possibilities of their future." K.B.</p>Featured in the book- - the best UFO/ET cases and the evidence for them - the best US and other official, government smoking gun documents related to UFOs - the remarkable Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind experiences of Dr.Greer and the CSETI research teams who have encountered and made contact with UFOs all over the world - a thought-provoking overview of why ETs are here, what are the implications of disclosing this knowledge to the world and how the world will change once the truth is known - an inside view of the famous CSETI Project Starlight briefings to President Clinton's first CIA Director, key members of Congress, the UN leadership and very senior Pentagon officials at the highest level of the military, among others. <p>Relying on first-hand knowledge from his CSETI research experiences and direct sources from covert projects, Dr. Greer brings a unique combination of scientific knowledge, credibility, vision, humor and inspiration to the subject. Arguably the most insightful book ever written on the subject of UFOs, ETs, and government secrecy.</p></p><h2>Harvest of the Cold Months: The Social History of Ice and Ices</h2><p>Long recognized as the doyenne of English culinary writing, David here displays the witty and well-furnished mind that made her famous. From sixteenth-century Italy and the splendor of the Medici banquets to seventeenth-century France and the Sun King, from travelers&#39; tales of snow pits and ice houses in Persia to the sherbet trade with the Levant to the use of ice as &#34;table jewelry,&#34; and from the influential ice trade in Boston to the growth of the ice cream business in London, this impressive book brings alive the centuries in which ice, far from being commonplace, was a subject that inspired and challenged the human imagination.</p><p>A seminal food writer, Elizabeth David brought Mediterranean cuisine to English readers and became a national institution, her cookbooks beloved not only for their recipes but for their literary depth. In the 1970s David began researching ice-cream. It was an innocent enough idea, but she got side-tracked--the result was 20 years of research into the whole history of ice and ice-making, and this book, which she died before completing (it has been finished by Jill Norman). As revealed in extracts from the earliest writings on the subject, ice, before the days of refrigeration, was an item prized by the mightiest and warmest empires. Though not a cookbook, this encyclopedic treatise on ice won a 1995 Julia Child Cookbook Award for Literary Food Writing, and a Jane Grigson Award.Elizabeth David (1913-1992) was one of the most successful food writers of the twentieth century. She discovered her taste for good food and wine when, as a student at the Sorbonne, she lived with a French family for two years. After returning to England she made up her mind to learn to cook, so that that she could reproduce for herself and her friends some of the food that she had come to appreciate in France. Subsequently she lived in France, Italy, Greece, Egypt and India, learning and writing about the local dishes and cooking them in her own kitchen. Her first book, <b>Mediterranean Food</b>, signalled the start of a dazzling writing career, and was followed by many others, now considered classics, such as <b>French Country Cooking</b><i>, </i>and <b>Italian Food</b><i>. </i>The publication of <b>French Provincial Cooking</b> in 1960 confirmed her position as the most inspirational and influential cookery writer in the English language, and she was the recipient of many awards.Elizabeth David was also interested in the literature of cookery, and at the time of her death she was working on a study of the use of ice, the ice-trade and the early days of refrigeration, published posthumously as <b>Harvest of the Cold Months</b>.</p><h2>Mister B.

But just why do the humpback whales sing? That's the question that has Nate and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing any large marine mammal that crosses their path. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.</p><p>No one on Nate's team has ever seen such a thing; not his longtime partner, photographer Clay Demodocus, not their saucy young research assistant, Amy. Not even spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman, Kona (the former Preston Applebaum of New Jersey), could boast such a sighting in one of his dope-induced hallucinations. And when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot -- and their research facility is summarily trashed -- Nate realizes that something very fishy indeed is going on.</p><p>This, apparently, is big, involving dangerously interested other parties -- competitive researchers, the cutthroat tourist industry, perhaps even the military. The weirdness only gets weirder when a call comes in from Nate's big-bucks benefactor saying that a whale has made contact -- by phone. And it's asking for a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye. Suddenly the answer to the question that has daunted and driven Nate throughout his adult life is within his reach. But it's waiting for him in the form of an amazing adventure beneath the waves, 623 feet down, somewhere off the coast of Chile. And it's not what anyone would think.</p><p>It must be said: Christopher Moore's <em>Fluke</em> is a whale of a novel.</p></p><p>In his entertaining adventure-in-whale-researching, <i>Fluke, or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings</i>, Nathan Quinn, a prominent marine biologist, has been conducting studies in Hawaii for years trying to unravel the secret of why humpback whales sing. During a typical day of data gathering, Nate believes his mind is failing: the subject whale has "Bite Me" scrawled across its tail. Events become even stranger as the self-proclaimed "action nerds," Nate, photographer Clay, their research assistant Amy, and Kona, a white Rasta (a Jewish kid from New Jersey), encounter sabotage to their data and equipment. They also observe increasingly bizarre whale behavior, including a phone call from the whale to their wealthy sponsor to ask that Nate bring it a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye, and discover both a thriving underwater city and the secret to what happened to Amelia Earhart. <p> Thoughtful, irreverent, and often hilarious, Moore has crafted a tale that contains a bit of the saga of declining whale populations due to hunting and habitat destruction, as well as his over-the-top, decadent wit as applied to scientific methodology and professional jealousies. Moore notes a pasty, rival scientist "looked like Death out for his after-dinner stroll before a busy night of e-mailing heart attacks and tumors to a few million lucky winners," and that killer whales (which are all named Kevin), are "just four tons of doofus dressed up like a police car." Smart, sincere, and a whale of a story, <i>Fluke</i> is terrific. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><p>Christopher Moore is the author of fourteen previous novels, including <em>Lamb, The Stupidest Angel, Fool, Sacr� Bleu, A Dirty Job,</em> and <em>The Serpent of Venice.</em></p></p><h2>LIFE Guide to Digital Photography: Everything You Need to Shoot Like the Pros</h2><p>Photography has been the business and the passion of LIFE since the original weekly magazine's inception in 1936, and it continues to be the business and passion of LIFE Books and LIFE.com in the new millennium. But photography has surely changed during these many decades. The rigs and gear of old have given way-first slowly, then all at once-to sleek miracle machines that process pixels and have made the darkroom obsolete. The casual photog puts eye to lens, sets everything on auto and captures a photograph that is . . . perfectly fine.<br><br> One of LIFE's master shooters-in fact, the final in the long line of distinguished LIFE staff photographers-was Joe McNally, and he has always believed that with a little preparation and care, with a dash of enthusiasm and daring added to the equation, anyone can make a better photo-anyone can turn a "keeper" into a treasure. This was true in days of yore, and it's true in the digital age. Your marvelous new camera, fresh from its box, can indeed perform splendid feats. Joe explains in this book how to take best advantage of what it was designed to do, and also when it is wise to outthink your camera or push your camera-to go for the gold, to create that indelible family memory that you will have blown up as large as the technology will allow, and that will hang on the wall forevermore.<br><br> As the storied LIFE photographer and photo editor John Loengard points out in his eloquent foreword to this volume, there are cameras and there are cameras, and they've always been able to do tricks. And then there is photography. Other guides may give you the one, two, three of producing a reasonably well exposed shot, but Joe McNally and the editors of LIFE can give you that, and then can show you how to make a picture. In a detailed, friendly, conversational, anecdotal, sometimes rollicking way, that's what they do in these pages. <br><br> Prepare to click.</p><p>Joe McNally is an internationally acclaimed photographer, whose career has spanned 30 years and included assignments in over 50 countries.

Seth is awkward and shy. Carter is the glamorous heir to one of America's great fortunes. They have one thing in common: an obsession with music. Seth is desperate to reach for the future.

When Seth accidentally records an unknown singer in a park, Carter sends it out over the Internet, claiming it's a long lost 1920s blues recording by a musician called Charlie Shaw. When an old collector contacts them to say that their fake record and their fake bluesman are actually real, the two young white men, accompanied by Carter's troubled sister Leonie, spiral down into the heart of the nation's darkness, encountering a suppressed history of greed, envy, revenge, and exploitation.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2017:</strong> Thrumming with humor and revelation, <em>White Tears</em> by Hari Kunzru (author of the 2012 novel <em>Gods without Men</em>) is a smart, incisive portrait of music, male friendship, and race. At its most basic level, Kunzru weaves a story of two best friends who get caught in the deadly underworld of record collecting. When their new song is mistaken for an authentic and rare 1950s recording, violence ensues and the dangerous quest to discover the true 1950s musician unravels the reality of racism. The novel&#x2019;s brilliance and beat is derived from the story Kunzru tells about white privilege, the exploitation of black culture and how they reverberate through life and music. Kunzru is a skilled writer &#x2013; his descriptions of 1950s blues will make any music buff start tapping their toe; and his ability to render America&#x2019;s relationship with race is as haunting and unforgettable as the song the novel is centered on. <em>--Al Woodworth, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>HARI KUNZRU </b>is the author of four previous novels.

The PBS series <i>Connections</i> was over two years in the making, the research and filming taking the author to twenty-three countries. James Burke lives in London.</p>James Burke synthesizes the entire course of Western history and science into this brief audiobook about how "knowledge" is subjective to the time and place in which it is created. He takes this argument further in explaining why and how science can be subjective, despite claims to the contrary. He delivers all this in a smooth and crisp British accent that reveals his experience in broadcasting, and his career with the BBC lends his voice subtle authority. However, listeners may feel overwhelmed with his long-winded explanations, which sometimes lose touch with where they started. Burke's delivery needs something more to keep listeners engaged, such as background music or more musical interludes to facilitate transitions.

A first novel.</p><p>Alastair Reynolds's first novel is "hard" SF on an epic scale, crammed with technological marvels and immensities. Its events take place over a relatively short period, but have roots a billion years old--when the Dawn War ravaged our galaxy.<p> Sylveste is the only man ever to return alive and sane from a Shroud, an enclave in space protected by awesome gravity-warping defenses: "a folding a billion times less severe should have required more energy than was stored in the entire rest-mass of the galaxy." Now an intuition he doesn't understand makes him explore the dead world Resurgam, whose birdlike natives long ago tripped some booby trap that made their own sun erupt in a deadly flare.</p><p> Meanwhile, the vast, decaying lightship <i>Nostalgia for Infinity</i> is coming for Sylveste, whose dead father (in AI simulation) could perhaps help the Captain, frozen near absolute zero yet still suffering monstrous transformation by nanotech plague. Most of <i>Infinity</i>'s tiny crew have hidden agendas--Khouri the reluctant contract assassin believes she must kill Sylveste to save humanity--and there are two bodiless stowaways, one no longer human and one never human. Shocking truths emerge from bluff, betrayal, and ingenious lies.</p><p> The trail leads to a neutron star where an orbiting alien construct has defenses to challenge the Infinity's planet-wrecking superweapons.</p><p> At the heart of this artifact, the final revelations detonate--most satisfyingly. Dense with information and incident, this longish novel has no surplus fat and seems almost too short.

An intensely private man, Nabokov was uprooted first by the Russian Revolution and then by World War II. Transformed into a permanent wanderer, he did not achieve fame until late in life, with the success of Lolita. In this first of two volumes, Brian Boyd vividly describes the liberal milieu of the aristocratic Nabokovs, their escape from Russia, Nabokov's education at Cambridge, and the murder of his father in Berlin. Boyd then turns to the years that Nabokov spent, impoverished, in Germany and France, until the coming of Hitler forced him to flee, with wife and son, to the United States. This volume stands on its own as a fascinating exploration of Nabokov's Russian years and Russian worlds, prerevolutionary and �migr�.</p><br><p> In the course of his ten years' work on the biography, Boyd traveled along Nabokov's trail everywhere from Yalta to Palo Alto. The only scholar to have had free access to the Nabokov archives in Montreux and the Library of Congress, he also interviewed at length Nabokov's family and scores of his friends and associates.</p><br><p> For the general reader, Boyd offers an introduction to Nabokov the man, his works, and his world. For the specialist, he provides a basis for all future research on Nabokov's life and art, as he dates and describes the composition of all Nabokov's works, published and unpublished.</p><br><p> Boyd investigates Nabokov's relation to and his independence from his time, examines the special structures of his mind and thought, and explains the relations between his philosophy and his innovations of literary strategy and style. At the same time he provides succinct introductions to all the fiction, dramas, memoirs, and major verse; presents detailed analyses of the major books that break new ground for the scholar, while providing easy paths into the works for other readers; and shows the relationship between Nabokov's life and the themes and subjects of his art.</p></p><p><p>"This is the first comprehensive account of Nabokov's life and oeuvre. The book's wide-ranging research and deep affinity for Nabokov's writings should establish it as the single indispensable source on its subject for many decades to come."<b>--Simon Karlinsky, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><b>Brian Boyd</b> is Distinguished University Professor in the Department of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

Through sinister understatement, George Guidall conveys the horror of the wolves and the growing tension of the group's arrival at their destination. Guidall shows startling ineptitude for the protagonist's Maine accent but invests the Calla people with a language all their own, identifiable and consistent throughout the production. His characterization of series character Susannah Dean somewhat reprises Frank Muller's excellent portrayal, but, for the most part, Guidall underplays vocal distinctions among the characters. R.P.L. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Mary, Called Magdalene</h2><p>Draws on the Bible and secular historical research to present a fictional portrait of Mary of Magdala as she becomes part of Jesus&#39;s disciple circle and comes into a realization of her faith. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Of all the women in the Bible, perhaps no one's presence has been as constantly reinterpreted as that of Mary Magdalene. Was she a prostitute? A prophet? In Margaret George's epic historical novel, <i>Mary, Called Magdalene</i> (Geroge's previous subjects include Henry VIII, Mary, Queen of Scots, and Cleopatra), Mary comes alive as one of Jesus' first believers, a woman of infallible visions and a faith that earns her the title "Apostle to the Apostles." With numerous biblical and scholarly texts serving as the core of this intriguing woman's story, George recreates the world of Galilean fishermen and the oppressions of the Jewish people under Roman rule. Cast out from her family after Jesus expels the demons that have ravaged her mind, Mary follows the man from Nazareth until they receive attention from the skeptical hordes and the Roman magistrates controlling Jerusalem. <p> Mary, from beginning to end of this giant undertaking, is a woman who struggles to reconcile her absence from her young daughter's life with the chance to be part of something important. Through the lens of her ever-inquisitive mind, the story covers the formation of Jesus' ragtag band of disciples and the crucifixion, and ends with Mary's mission as the head of the Christian church in Ephesus, where she died at the age of 90. What makes this a compelling read is that Mary's story connects humanity with faith in a way that's possible to understand, whatever our contemporary beliefs. <i>--Emily Russin</i></p>Margaret George, a tenth-generation American, is the author of the bestselling <i>The Autobiography of Henry VIII</i>, <i>Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Cleopatra</i>.

Now, she shares her famous design philosophies and secrets, and inspires readers to create unexpected style in their own homes. Through full&#x2013;colour photographs and sketches and informative text, Kelly explains the elements of unexpected style: inspiration, shapes and forms, graphics, texture and colour, masculine vs. feminine, and unusual details. Kelly takes readers through the creative process and shows how a Franco&#x2013;Chinese piece of vintage wallpaper led her to a shopping spree in Paris and inspired the layered, classic look of the hotel Maison 140 in Beverly Hills. She explains the need for "icebreakers" in a room and how unexpected designs and details can lighten a room's load. </p><p> This is the perfect book for anyone looking for new and creative ways to decorate their homes. Whether it's shopping for a bedside table, putting reflective paint on the underside of a dining room table, or finishing a ceiling with high&#x2013;gloss paint, she inspires readers to add an element of the unexpected to their homes. Others will enjoy living vicariously through Kelly's shopping sprees throughout the US, Asia, and Europe and appreciate discovering how each item found is a starting off point for a fresh and fun room design.</p><p> </p></p><p><p>Kelly Wearstler is the author of <em>Modern Glamour</em> and the founder of the Los Angeles architectural interior design firm kwid (Kelly Wearstler Interior Design). Her designs for the trendsetting Viceroy resorts from California to the Caribbean; such taste-making hotels as Maison 140 and Avalon; unique office, retail, and leisure spaces, including BG restaurant and lounge in Manhattan's Bergdorf Goodman; and upscale residences such as the Trousdale Estate have been profiled in House and Garden, House Beautiful, Interior Design, Elle D�cor, Vogue, and W. Wearstler is also designer of her own kwid line of furnishings and accessories. She lives in Beverly Hills with her husband, hotelier Brad Korzen, and their sons. </p>Bold, complex, decadent, dizzying, rich, colorful: Wearstler&#x2019;s residential and hotel designs are not for the faint of heart. The founder of the Los Angeles "architectural interior design" firm KWID worked as a Hollywood set designer before she decided to focus on real-life living spaces, and her vibrant, multi-layered interiors still look like backdrops for drama. In this design cum promotional book, Wearstler explains her aesthetic philosophy and lays out suggestions for those readers who would like to emulate her "unusual and kaleidoscopic" style, which graces such famous California hotels as the Viceroy, Estella and Maison 140. Certainly, the book&#x2019;s large, full-bleed color photographs do justice to the variety of her creations. One two-page spread showcases a bathroom tiled in maroon, pink and white stripes and lit with a dainty glass and gold chandelier. Another shows a cool, all-white bedroom decorated with a silver bamboo chair and a black wood bedframe. Wearstler encourages readers to stop thinking about rooms in terms of furniture and accessories and to start imagining them as combinations of color, texture, shape and form. This, she writes, is the secret to creating a "graphic style ... that lends itself to crispness and richness that make you say &#x2018;Wow.&#x2019;" While there&#x2019;s no firm, step-by-step advice in the volume&#x2014;a chapter on "Process" does little more than describe her office&#x2019;s client meetings&#x2014;the photographs and the author&#x2019;s attitude will surely inspire amateurs who are looking for a design style that goes beyond Pottery Barn, Crate &amp; Barrel and Ikea.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was raised by her Newark-tough single mom, Teri, a woman who loved the world of show business and was often a media sensation all by herself. Brooke's iconic modeling career began by chance when she was only eleven months old, and Teri's skills as both Brooke's mother and manager were formidable. But in private she was troubled and drinking heavily.<br><br>As Brooke became an adult the pair made choices and sacrifices that would affect their relationship forever. And when Brooke&#x2019;s own daughters were born she found that her experience as a mother was shaped in every way by the woman who raised her. But despite the many ups and downs, Brooke was by Teri&#x2019;s side when she died in 2012, a loving daughter until the end.<br><br>Only Brooke knows the truth of the remarkable, difficult, complicated woman who was her mother. And now, in an honest, open memoir about her life growing up, Brooke will reveal stories and feelings that are relatable to anyone who has been a mother or daughter.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> In her previous memoir, <i>Down Came the Rain</i>, Brooke Shields described her post-partum depression so frankly and powerfully, she probably helped a lot of women, even if she did annoy fellow actor Tom Cruise, who disputed Shields&#x2019; contention that anti-depressants are helpful. The only person she might have upset with her new memoir, however, is her late mother, Teri Shields, who, on almost every page, is outed as a serious alcoholic and &#x201c;a tough broad who could fight.&#x201d; (Ok, onetime boyfriend, Liam Neesen doesn&#x2019;t come off so great, and ex-husband Andre Agassi isn&#x2019;t going to be thrilled, either&#x2014;but at least Brooke was nicer to the latter than he was to her in his memoir, <i>Open</i>.) Still, Shields-the-daughter also praises the complicated working-class beauty she both adored and abhorred&#x2014;sections about Teri fighting for her minor daughter&#x2019;s rights while on the New Orleans set of &#x201c;Pretty Baby&#x201d; live next to suggestions that Teri might have chosen the hotel the family stayed in because of its proximity to a favorite bar. As an adult, Brooke (who as a child called legendary fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo &#x201c;uncle Frankie&#x201d;) rotated between estrangement from and reconciliation with her mother; today, she thinks plenty about their relationship as she and writer/producer Chris Henchy raise their two daughters. In other words, what could have been a next-generation Mommy Dearest becomes something else: a (sometimes painfully) frank account of growing up in a seriously privileged but painfully dysfunctional family and how one might possibly break such a cycle. <i> &#x2013;Sara Nelson</i></p>BROOKE SHIELDS is an award-winning actress and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author.

She touts the joys creating front yard&#x2013;friendly raised beds and container gardens that take up only a small amount of space and look beautiful to boot, and shares ideas for tucking productive gardens in other small nooks and corners.<br>Teegen's unique cuisine-based planting methods mean herbs, vegetables, and edible flowers grow next to each other in comingled plots&#x2014;quickly, reliably, and efficiently. You'll find more than 40 top picks for small-space vegetables that yield big and are trouble-free, plus a variety of menus and 50 recipes for fresh and delicious summer dishes.<br>With food prices on the rise and concern over pesticide residues on produce ever present, the number of home owners growing vegetables nearly doubled in the last year. Homegrown shows that even urban and suburban dwellers can grow their own vegetables in easy-to-tend plots and spaces.</p><p>MARTA TEEGEN is a trained master gardener and chef. She worked in politics and the nonprofi t sector before pursuing her lifelong love of gardening and cooking. She lives in Los Angeles.1<br><br>GARDEN OF EDEN<br><br>What looks good today?<br><br>It's a simple enough question when you're at the market, running your fingers over a tomato, subtly squeezing it, and wondering if that waxy sheen is natural or not. It's markedly more complicated when you're shopping for food to serve at an organic restaurant.<br><br>One of my restaurant jobs took me to the aisles of the Santa Monica farmers' market, looking for both the staples and the exotic items, mentally keeping track of the changes we would need to make to the menu based on what was perfectly ripe that day.<br><br>In my world, my garden, and my kitchen, something is either ready to eat, at the peak of its freshness, or it's not.<br><br>It's that simple.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is not the case in the produce sections of most supermarkets. There, ripeness is a subjective term, and any appearance of ripeness may be a mere gilding of the lily, as maturity is not actually achieved but rather is applied through the processes of industrial food production. Veggies are taken from the field still green and are then sprayed with chemical showers to protect their skin, speed up coloration, and delay spoilage.<br><br>From the cook's point of view, there is no comparison between fresh from the garden and fresh from the grocery store bag. If you don't have the best- quality ingredients to work with, it doesn't matter what you're doing with them: The results will always be average. Once you are able to eat food at peak ripeness after growing it perfectly yourself, you'll never go back to the grocery store.<br><br> As a kitchen garden designer, I have developed a few guiding principles: Prepare your garden based on what you eat, have good materials at the start, look to nature as your guide for both diversity and design, and-like nature-be patient as well as ruthless.<br><br>PLANT WHAT YOU EAT<br><br>It is essential to remember that the goal is to plant your garden based on your eating habits and then to plan meals based on what is harvestable at any given time. While you may have to wait through a long summer to harvest the first Charentais melon, the sweetness of its flesh, still warm from the sun, is incomparable. As I patiently wait for my tomatoes to mature, I enjoy a salad of mixed lettuces, arugula, chives, dill, marjoram, parsley, sorrel, and upland cress. And when my tomatoes do come in, my basil will be at least 2 feet tall, which means I can finally make pasta with fresh tomato sauce that's seasoned with fresh basil I've picked myself.<br><br>Ask yourself: What do you like to eat fresh? What do you eat again and again? What grows easily in your backyard microclimate? For me, it is very special to have daily access to fresh greens. This is my personal preference, and it's the reason I can always build a meal around what's in my garden, 50 feet from my kitchen. My first year, I planted a very wide variety of vegetables just to see what would work and what I wanted. I slowly pared that back to mostly cooking greens, salad greens, melons, and tomatoes.<br><br>DEFINITIONS<br><br>Intensive planting, interplanting, companion planting. These three terms describe three techniques for planting within the microclimate of your garden. Intensive planting means spacing plants close together and allowing them to overlap, sometimes even crowding each other significantly. Interplanting is the practice of planting between plants, although not necessarily as closely as you'd find in intensive plantings. Companion planting is selecting and planting together plants that have a beneficial impact on each other or the plants around them.<br><br>But don't think only in terms of individual vegetables-tomatoes or cucumbers, for example-but rather in terms of cuisines. While an Italian garden may include basil, eggplant, garlic, onions, oregano, pepperoncini, pole beans, red bell peppers, rosemary, sage, Swiss chard, and San Marzano tomatoes, an Asian garden may include bok choy, broccoli,cabbage, carrots, chile peppers, cilantro, cucumbers, eggplants, garlic, mustard, radishes, scallions, snow peas, soybeans, and yard-long beans. Such cuisine-based gardens overlap in some ways but are distinctly different in others. Happily, they can coexist, bringing variety not only to your garden but also to your kitchen and, ultimately, to your plate.<br><br>THE RIGHT MATERIALS: RAISED BEDS, GOOD SOIL, AND THE FRENCH INTENSIVE METHOD<br><br>The French intensive method, in brief, is a style of gardening that is designed to produce the greatest yields possible in a small area. It is organic and focused on maintaining soil health over successive seasons. Many of the aspects of what is now called the biointensive method (or simply "intensive") were used by ancient cultures around the world, from China to Greece to southern Mexico. It first took on a "scientific" mantle in 17th-century Paris, when it was popularized as a way of utilizing small spaces in ways that greatly increased yields. Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie, the head gardener to the Sun King, Louis XIV, is credited with systemizing this method for growing vegetables in an intensive manner, crowding the plantings in a closed system and relying upon horse manure to satisfy the nutritional demands of the gardens.<br><br>PLANT INTENSIVELY. With intensive planting, let nature be your guide for a beautiful, full, and abundant garden.<br><br>Your garden should begin with the right growing medium, as well as the right container. In some parts of the country, especially in the Midwest, excellent topsoil is a given-it's more the luck of the zip code than the luck of the draw. In Los Angeles and most other urban settings, however, yard soil can be clean fill or clay, and it may be rife with diseases or laced with long-outlawed pesticides, herbicides, or lead-based paints. Amending this type of soil is easier said than done; it often requires extensive laboratory tests and is much more complicated than simply scattering the soil with the proper amendments and digging them in, hoping for a miraculous reversal of problems with drainage, mineral depletion, and a lack of nutrients.<br><br>The solution I discovered, somewhat by accident, was to create a medium of stable bedding consisting of composted horse manure, wood shavings, and straw, amended with bonemeal and greensand and contained within raised beds of varying sizes. These are "growing-only, no-walking" areas that encourage extensive healthy root growth and limit soil compaction; they also allow more thorough and uniform drainage. While the raised beds can be made out of a variety of materials, from recycled concrete to brick to stone, I use inexpensive, untreated cedar boards that slip together with mortise and tenon joints, held in place by a wooden peg. Raised beds eliminate the heavy work that's often recommended when you start a new garden, such as double-digging soil a foot or more down to remove rocks, roots, and the inescapable accumulated detritus of an urban plot of land.<br><br>Remember: This isn't just about landscaping. It's about eating, and the objective is really twofold: to grow great ingredients for your kitchen- quickly, reliably, and efficiently-while at the same time growing great soil for your future plantings. You'll achieve the second objective through easy crop rotation (such as by alternately planting a cover crop or letting the soil rest through a season and planting appropriately the following year), adding amendments, and topping off the bed with a 1- to 2-inch layer of compost from your bins every growing season.<br><br>LOOKING TO NATURE<br><br>You may think that nature is the guiding force in many gardens. Seems obvious, right? Unfortunately, that's not the case. The "normal" vegetable garden today is very much a man-made phenomenon; there is nothing natural about tidy rows of plants positioned on top of tilled soil that's treated with chemical herbicides and pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. And the additives used in commercial farming were designed to increase harvests without concern for their impact on the environment, human health, or even the taste of the foods they produce.<br><br>It's a much better plan to emulate the natural landscape-just look to the local hillside, where there is a great mixture of plants competing for space. Those unlandscaped swaths of land, completely covered with a wide variety of plants standing cheek by jowl, should be your models. When plants have to literally struggle and fight with one another for their nutrients, air, and water, they're going to be stronger as a result. The intensive method I promote incorporates as much nature as possible into this process and calls for a diverse mix of plants in the kitchen garden, including vegetables, flowers, and herbs. This will create a healthy ecosystem where plants will thrive.<br><br>It may be hard to let go of what you think a vegetable patch is supposed to look like. But consider the way plants grow in nature-they're not in tidy rows. Your plants don't need wide spaces between them. I never have weeds in my gardens because weeds can't get a foothold-there is literally no room for them to grow. Weeds should never come up in an intensively planted garden. The goal is to have little to no soil surface exposed so there is no opportunity for weeds to grow.<br><br>While nature may be your guide in terms of diversity and density, you'll need to make your mark on the garden by deciding which plants earn their keep. The garden is not a democracy where the weak have to be protected from the strong. I am very interested in getting the best produce possible in the shortest amount of time, so if this goal is being stymied by bugs or disease, I'm ruthless-just like nature. If I have an aphid infestation, I'm likely to pull out the plant that's fallen victim and start over rather than nurse and baby it along. The point of growing vegetables is to eat them, and if a certain crop or variety is consuming my precious time because I have to coddle it, it will not be in my garden for long. My garden is filled with potential ingredients, but they are destined either for the kitchen or the compost bin, regardless. Ideally, you won't have many problems, as organic gardening tends to enable healthy plants rather than protect sick ones.<br><br>At the same time, be patient. It takes time for the miracle of photosynthesis to work its magic. Farmers plan seasons in advance; it's how they've survived since civilization began. Produce is available at farmers' markets year-round because it was grown in hothouses by growers forcing their vegetable plants during an off-season or using artificial lighting to encourage growth.<br><br>It takes time to grow food. Be patient and consistent. Visit your garden every day. Observe and participate.<br><br>Remember what this is all about-having amazing produce to cook with. Growing at home means your vegetables are picked when they are fully ripe and are eaten in season. You'll have access to the most tender and remarkable varieties-ones that commercial farmers and farmers' market growers won't grow because they'd never make it to market without spoiling.<br><br>Once harvested, let the food speak for itself; manipulate it as little as possible so it keeps its original taste and texture. This is my preferred way to cook and, not surprisingly, my preferred way to garden.<br><br>And finally, realize that this can and should be a beautiful experience, from garden to plate. One of my students is also a very gifted flower grower. She could never come to terms with having a vegetable garden because, in her words, they were always so "ugly"-these tidy rows of food just sitting in the ground. After the first season of growing in her intensively planted raised bed, she told me that it had never occurred to her that you could grow food with flowers and herbs mixed right in, or that such a garden could be so full and abundant.<br><br>Beautiful, full, abundant herbs and flowers. Throw in heirloom vegetables, and that's my Garden of Eden.</p><h2>Science Level Five</h2><p>Good clean copy with no missing pages.

Since 1961 he has been professor of Slavic languages and literature at the University of California at Berkeley.The great poet explores a miscellany of topics in miniature pieces of finely crafted prose and poetry. Milosz, the Polish migr writer of The Captive Mind (1951) and many works of poetry, is now 87 years old. He was a professor of Slavic language and literature at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1961 until 1980, when a Nobel Prize for Literature freed him of the need to hold a steady job. His output of poetry and essays has been prodigious; Road-Side Dog is his 24th book in English, and we have reason to be grateful for it. The book, brief and pithy, is a pleasure. Milosz turns his agile mind to whatever crosses its path. The upshot is a wealth of insights on a variety of topics. The task of poetry and the standing of the poet are favorite themes here. Milosz is inclined away from the avant-garde and toward the classical, toward the honing of the language of his predecessors: ``I was perfectly aware of how little of the world is scooped up by the net of my clauses and phrases. Like a monk, sentencing himself to ascesis, tormented by erotic visions, I would take shelter in rhythm and the order of syntax, because I was afraid of my chaos.'' He is also concerned in this collection with old age and memory (``one can write a few truly good things only by paying with the deformation of one's life''), with history (``Images more terrible than those invented by the phantasy''), and with the fleeting pleasures of life. What will impress many readers, though, is probably the remarkable compression of much wisdom in these pages, a wisdom that is as unpretentious as it is authentic. Milosz has a gift for acute observation and the ability to formulate what he understands in simple and beautiful prose. Though a modest and understated work, the poet's generosity of spirit is unmistakable. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And will Queenie be alive to see Harold arrive at her door?</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012:</strong> Harold Fry--retired sales rep, beleaguered husband, passive observer of his own life--decides one morning to walk 600 miles across England to save an old friend. It might not work, mind you, but that's hardly the point. In playwright Rachel Joyce's pitch-perfect first novel, Harold wins us over with his classic antiheroism. Setting off on the long journey, he wears the wrong jacket, doesn't have a toothbrush, and leaves his phone at home--in short, he is wholly, endearingly unprepared. But as he travels, Harold finally has time to reflect on his failings as a husband, father, and friend, and this helps him become someone we (and, more important, his wife Maureen) can respect. After walking for a while in Harold Fry's very human shoes, you might find that your own fit a bit better. --<i>Mia Lipman</i><p>The author, Rachel Joyce, has written over twenty original afternoon plays for BBC Radio 4, and has created major adaptations for the Classic series and Woman&#x2019;s Hour, as well as a TV drama adaptation for BBC2.

Lock the door at night.&#x201d; The Chief must have forgotten that it&#x2019;s a screen door at Grandpa&#x2019;s&#x2014;there is no key, no lock. The old house is a rust-checkered yellow bungalow at the edge of the wild bird estuary. It has a single, airless room; three crude, palmetto windows, with mosquito-blackened sills; a tin roof that hums with the memory of rain. I love it here. Whenever the wind gusts in off the river, the sky rains leaves and feathers. During mating season, the bedroom window rattles with the ardor of birds.<br><br>Now the thunder makes the thin window glass ripple like wax paper. Summer rain is still the most comforting sound that I know. I like to pretend that it&#x2019;s our dead mother&#x2019;s fingers, drumming on the ceiling above us. In the distance, an alligator bellows&#x2014;not one of ours, I frown, a free agent. Our gators are hatched in incubators. If they make any noise at all, it&#x2019;s a perfunctory grunt, bored and sated. This wild gator has an inimitable cry, much louder, much closer. I smile and pull the blankets around my chin. If Osceola hears it, she&#x2019;s not letting on. My sister is lying on the cot opposite me. Her eyes are wide open, and she is smiling and smiling in the dark.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Ossie? Is it just you in there?&#x201d;<br><br>My older sister has entire kingdoms inside of her, and some of them are only accessible at certain seasons, in certain kinds of weather.

You&#x2019;re not still going to, um,&#x201d; I pause, trying to remember her word, &#x201c;elope? Are you?&#x201d;<br><br>Ossie doesn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; she breathes, her eyes like blown embers. The thunder has gentled to a soft nicker. Outside, something is scratching at our dripping window. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;<br><br>You know, Ossie&#x2019;s possessions are nothing like those twitch-fests you read about in the Bible, no netherworld voices or pigs on a hill. Her body doesn&#x2019;t smolder like a firecracker, or ululate in dead languages. Her boyfriends possess her in a different way. They steal over her, silking into her ears and mouth and lungs, stealthy and pervasive, like sickness or swallowed water. I watch her metamorphosis in guilty, greedy increments. Ossie is sweating. Ossie is heavy-breathing. She puts her fist in her mouth, her other hand disappearing beneath the covers.<br><br>Then she moans, softly.<br><br>And I get that peculiar knot of fear and wonder and anger, the husk that holds my whole childhood. Here is another phase change that I don&#x2019;t understand, solid to void, happening in such close proximity to me. The ghost is here. I know it, because I can see my sister disappearing, can feel the body next to me emptying of my Ossie, and leaving me alone in the room. Luscious is her lewdest boyfriend yet. The ghost is moving through her, rolling into her hips, making Ossie do a jerky puppet dance under the blankets. This happens every night, lately, and I&#x2019;m helpless to stop him. Get out of here, Luscious! I think very loudly. Get back in your grave! You leave my sister alone. . . .<br><br>Hag-ridden, her cot is starting to swing.<br>I am so jealous of Ossie. Every time the lights flicker in a storm, or a dish clatters to the floor, it&#x2019;s a message from her stupid boyfriend. The wind in her hair, the wind in the trees, all of it a whistled valentine. And meanwhile who is busy decapitating stinking ballyhoo for the gators? Who is plunging the Bigtree latrines, and brushing the plaster teeth inside the Gator Head? Exactly. At sixteen, Ossie is four years my senior and twice my height. Yet somehow I&#x2019;m the one who gets stuck doing all the work. That&#x2019;s the reward for competence, I guess. When the Chief left, he put me in charge of the whole park.<br><br>Our family owns Swamplandia!, the island&#x2019;s #1 Gator Theme Park and Swamp Caf�, although lately we&#x2019;ve been slipping in the rankings.

Mom took care of all the shadowy, behind-the-scenes stuff: clubbing sick gators, fueling up the airboats, butchering chickens. I didn&#x2019;t even know these ugly duties existed. I&#x2019;m pretty sure Ossie is still oblivious. Osceola doesn&#x2019;t have to do chores. &#x201c;Your sister is special,&#x201d; the Chief has tried to explain to me, on more than one occasion. I don&#x2019;t cotton to this sophist logic. I&#x2019;m special too. My name is a palindrome. I can climb trees with simian ease. I can gut buckets of chub fish in record time. Once Grandpa Sawtooth held a dead Seth&#x2019;s jaws open, and I stuck my whole head in his fetid mouth.<br><br>There are only two Swamplandia! duties that I can&#x2019;t handle on my own: stringing up the swamp hens on Live Chicken Thursdays, and pulling those gators out of the water. This means that I can&#x2019;t compete in the junior leagues, or perform solo. It doesn&#x2019;t bother me enough to make me braver. I still refuse to wade into the pit, and anyways, I am too weak to get my own gator ashore. Our show is simple: the headlining wrestler, usually the Chief, wades into the water, making a big show of hunting the sandy bottom for his Seth. Then he pulls a gator out by its thrashing tail. The gator immediately lurches forward, yanking the Chief back into the water. The Chief pulls him out again, and again the infuriated gator pulls my father towards the water. This tug-of-war goes on for a foamy length of time, while the crowd whoops and wahoos, cheering for our species.<br><br>Finally, the Chief masters his Seth. He manages to get him landlocked and clamber onto his back. This is the part where I come in. Aunt Hilola strikes up a manic tune on the calliope&#x2014;<i>ba-da-DOOM-bop-bop!</i>&#x2014;and then I&#x2019;m cartwheeling out across the sand, careful to keep a grin on my face even as I land on the gator&#x2019;s armor-plated scutes. My thighs are waffled with the shadow of those scutes. Up close, the Seths are beautiful, with corrugated gray-green backs and dinosaur feet. The Chief, meanwhile, has taken advantage of my showy entrance to lasso black electrical tape around the Seth&#x2019;s snout. He takes my bare hands and holds them up to the crowd, splaying my little palms for their amusement.<br><br>Then he closes them around Seth&#x2019;s jaws. I smile and smile at the tourists. Inside my tight fist, the Seth strains and strains against the tape. The Chief keeps his meaty hands on top of my own, obscuring the fact that I am doing any work at all. The Chief likes to remind me that the tourists don&#x2019;t pay to watch us struggle.<br>At some point, I must have dozed off, because when I wake up the screen door is banging in the wind. I glance at my watch: 12:07. When Mom was alive, Ossie had a ten o&#x2019;clock curfew. I guess technically she still does, but nobody&#x2019;s here to enforce it. She lets Luscious possess her for hours at a time. It makes me furious to think about this, and a little jeal- ous, Luscious taking Ossie&#x2019;s body on a joy ride through the swamp. I worry about her. She could be deep into the slash pines by now, or halfway to the pond. But if I leave the house, then I&#x2019;ll be breaking the rules, too. I pull the covers over my head and bite my lip. A surge of unused adrenaline leaves me feeling sick and quakey. The next thing I know, I&#x2019;m yanking my boots on and running out the door, as if I were the one possessed.<br><br>Strange lights burn off the swamp at night. Overhead, the clouds stretch across the sky like some monstrous spider- web, dewed with stars. Tiny planes from the Mainland whir towards the yellow moon, only to become cobwebbed by cloud. Osceola is much easier than an animal to track. She&#x2019;s mowed a drunken path through the scrub. The reeds grow tall and thick around me, hissing in the wind like a thousand vipers. Every few steps, I glance back at the receding glow of the house.<br><br>Several paces ahead ...</p><h2>Sentieri</h2><p>Sentieri 2nd Ed Student Edition</p><p></p><h2>The Rodale Herb Book: How to Use, Grow, and Buy Nature&#39;s Miracle Plants</h2><p>In addition to descriptions of numerous herbs, recipes and planting and landscaping tips are offered</p><p></p><h2>How to Heal with Color</h2><p><p>Everyone is affected by color.

[<em>A New Kind of Christianity</em>] is one of these.&#x201d; &#x2014;Peter Rollins, <em>Ikon</em> </p><p><em>A New Kind of Christianity</em> is Brian D. McLaren&#x2019;s much anticipated follow-up to his breakthrough work of the emergent-church movement, <em>A New Kind of Christian</em>. Named by <em>Time</em> magazine as one of America&#x2019;s top 25 evangelicals, McLaren, along with such contemporaries as N.T. Wright, Jim Wallis, and Rob Bell, is one of the acknowledged leaders of a new generation of Christians who want to update their faith for current times while remaining true to the core message of Jesus. In this controversial and thought-provoking book, McLaren explores the questions that will determine the shape of Christianity for the next 500 years. </p></p><p><blockquote><p>"Wherever the willingness to rethink has been squelched, wherever that sense of quest has been buried under convention and complacency, the Christian faith in all its forms is in trouble. But even there, something is trying to be born. Even now, right here, among us, inside you, inside me. You may feel it as a curiosity, a desire for better answers than you inherited so far. You may experience it as frustration, knowing that there must be more to faith than you currently know. You may know it as hope, hope that God is seeking humble people whose hearts and lives can be the womb of a better future. . . . In you, your family, your faith community, and circles of friends, among people of peace and faith everywhere, something is trying to be born."<br>&#x2014;from <em>A New Kind of Christianity</em></p></blockquote><p>We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in the church. Not since the Reformation five centuries ago have so many Christians come together to ask whether the church is in sync with their deepest beliefs and commitments. These believers range from evangelicals to mainline Protestants to Catholics, and the person who best represents them is author and pastor Brian McLaren.</p><p>In this much anticipated book, McLaren examines ten questions facing today's church&#x2014;questions about how to articulate the faith itself, the nature of its authority, who God is, whether we have to understand Jesus through only an ancient Greco-Roman lens, what exactly the good news is that the gospel proclaims, how we understand the church and all its varieties, why we are so preoccupied with sex, how we should think of the future and people from other faiths, and the most intimidating question of all: what do we do next? Here you will find a provocative and enticing introduction to the Christian faith of tomorrow.</p><p>Brian D. McLaren, hailed as one of America's 25 most influential evangelicals by <em>Time</em> magazine, is a speaker, social justice activist, pastor, and the author of <em>A New Kind of Christianity</em>, <em>A Generous Orthodoxy</em>, <em>A New Kind of Christian</em>, and <em>The Secret Message of Jesus</em>.

For more than a thousand years, Sepharad (the Hebrew word for Spain) was home to a large Jewish community noted for its richness and virtuosity. Summarily expelled in 1492 and forced into exile, their tragedy of expulsion marked the end of one critical phase of their history and the beginning of another. Indeed, in defiance of all logic and expectation, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain became an occasion for renewed creativity. Nor have five hundred years of wandering extinguished the identity of the Sephardic Jews, or diminished the proud memory of the dazzling civilization which they created on Spanish soil.This book is intended to serve as an introduction and scholarly guide to that history.Before the brutal expulsion of 300,000 Jews from Spain in 1492, Sephardic Jews thrived on the Iberian peninsula for more than a millennium, as Gerber relates in this stirring and riveting saga, a remarkable story of creative adaptation, minority achievement and survival. During the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry, Sephardim excelled in medicine, science, philosophy, music and literature. Columbus, evasive about his origins, kept close company with Jews, and several Jewish converts sailed with him. Gerber, director of the City University of New York's Graduate Center's Institute for Sephardic Studies, charts the haunted lives of "New Christians," secret Jews who were persecuted by the Inquisition, from Mexico to Peru, and surveys Sephardic communities that flourished openly from Romania, Syria and Turkey to the U.S. and Barbados. She examines the tensions between impoverished Ashkenazim (Jews of middle and northern Europe) and aristocratic Sephardim throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Betrayals and horrors of WW II and the Holocaust reinforced Sephardic Jews' resolve to leave the Muslim world, and Gerber incisively looks at today's Sephardic communities in Israel, France, the U.S. and Spain. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Uncover a Dog (Uncover Books)</h2><p>Winner of a Parents' Choice Approved Award, <i>Uncover a Dog</i> takes an inside look at the special anatomical and behavioral characteristics that make dogs our most trusted and lovable animal companions.

In fact, the book was written for cardiologists to alert them to the power of food to alter hormonal responses, especially those hormones involved in inflammation. The book was meant as a clarion call to the medical community that the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet being recommended to the American public by the medical establishment was going to lead to epidemics of obesity and diabetes driven by increased inflammation. Not inflammation caused by a microbe or an injury, but inflammation caused by what we were eating.<br> &nbsp;<br> The focus of The Zone was on a little known group of hormones called eicosanoids. Even though the 1982 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for understanding the importance of these hormones in driving inflammation, outside of a few in academic medicine, by 1995 still virtually no one knew anything about them.<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew that getting attention for the book was going to be a challenge, and my publisher readily agreed. So neither of us was surprised that the initial sales of The Zone were modest and quickly petered out. I was convinced that the right message wasn&#x2019;t getting across, and that the media were looking at this book as just another fad diet book. Recklessly (without telling my wife), I went in search of a publicity firm that could help reposition the message of The Zone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since I grew up in Los Angeles, I figured if you could publicize films, you probably could do the same for books&#x2014;even technical books on diet-induced inflammation. (Talk about being na�ve.) So I went to the top PR firm in Hollywood and asked them if they had ever publicized a book. Their answer was no, but they were not willing turn a client away, so Michael Keaton&#x2019;s press agent became the head of their new book publicity department with me as their first client.<br> &nbsp;<br> I told them the only way I could judge their efforts was by any increase in book sales (which wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard). Not much happened at first, but with only about four more weeks to go before my money ran out, I caught a break when Dennis Prager, a prominent LA radio talk show host, agreed to have me on his program because we both shared the same publisher. Although he liked the book, he made it clear that if there weren&#x2019;t any callers in the first fifteen minutes, he would have to take me off the air. I told him I was just happy to get a chance to discuss the book. Three hours later, the phone lines were still jammed with callers, and I was still on the show. The book became the #1 best seller in Los Angeles the next week and a month later the #1 best seller on the New York Times book list. This only confirms the old saying, &#x201c;Given the choice of being good or being lucky, always opt for being lucky.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, with this new success my two most dreaded words&#x2014;fad diet&#x2014;were immediately attached to the book. Although the word diet comes from the ancient Greek root meaning &#x201c;way of life,&#x201d; it has been corrupted to imply a short-term period of hunger and deprivation to try to look good in a swimsuit. A fad is a short-term phenomenon without substance that will soon fade. Put these two words together, and you have fad diet. Some fad diets are simply ridiculous, such as the Drinking Man&#x2019;s Diet. Other fad diets, unfortunately, gain substantial credence, such as the low-fat, high-carbohydrate (rich in grains and starches) diet supported by the USDA in the early 1990s. This fad had the initial support of the government and the medical establishment, but it&#x2019;s clear today that this policy led to an explosion of obesity in America.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s why I developed the concept of the Zone&#x2014;not as a diet or a weight-loss program, but as a dietary road map for reaching and maintaining a constant hormonal balance that allows the body to operate at peak efficiency. The Zone is a real physiological state that can be measured in the body&#x2014;a metabolic state that, once you reach it, works quickly to dramatically diminish your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and many other chronic health issues. Reaching the Zone and staying there requires a dietary lifestyle change that has to be followed for a lifetime, but it is one that will allow us to look, feel, and live healthier for many years to come.<br> &nbsp;<br> For several years after the publication of The Zone, I spent my time like any good politician pressing the flesh trying to explain the mysterious world of hormones and inflammation. Now, nearly twenty years later, the once radical concept of the Zone seems almost old-fashioned, because today most diet books stress that hormones are involved in weight gain&#x2014;excess insulin makes you fat and keeps you fat. Likewise, most diet books tell you if you eat too many white carbohydrates (bread, pasta, and pizza), you are going to gain weight.<br> &nbsp;<br> But very few of today&#x2019;s diet books talk about inflammation as the underlying cause of why these things happen, and why it&#x2019;s so critical to control.<br> &nbsp;<br> The reason the Zone concept went from being labeled a fad diet to mainstream nutrition is the science. When The Zone was first published, one of the few people who actually bought the book was David Ludwig, then a young Harvard Medical School instructor. (He is now a full professor at Harvard and one of the leading researchers in the study of obesity.) Actually, David first read the book with an academic&#x2019;s skeptical eye, concerned about pseudoscience lurking behind another fad diet. After reading the book and seeing the early scientific support (it was the first diet book to actually contain scientific references), he asked me to give a seminar to his colleagues in the division of endocrinology at Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital at Harvard.<br> &nbsp;<br> So I gave my seminar, and at the end I asked if there were any obvious fallacies to my concepts. The answer was no, since everyone seemed to be satisfied that everything I said was theoretically reasonable. Intrigued by my presentation, David decided to test my Zone concept in a controlled-feeding study. He used internal funds at Children&#x2019;s Hospital, because his initial attempts to get government funding for this &#x201c;radical&#x201d; idea were rejected.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sure enough, David and his group found my predictions about the ability of the Zone Diet (and in particular just a single meal put together based on the Zone principles) to alter hormonal responses were true. Since then, one carefully controlled study after another has confirmed what I hypothesized twenty years ago about the power of food to control hormonal responses and reduce inflammation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Has anything changed in my thinking about the Zone over the years? Well, yes and no. The Zone was the first book to describe anti-inflammatory diets and how the hormonal response to diet could either increase or decrease the levels of inflammation in the body. The Zone Diet provides a dietary blueprint for balancing food ingredients on your plate for optimal hormonal, inflammatory, and genetic control for a lifetime (as opposed to being &#x201c;on a diet&#x201d; and constantly hungry and fatigued in order to lose a few pounds). Nothing has changed about that basic concept. But new research continues to demonstrate just how critical it is that we act now to bring inflammation under control and how certain food ingredients can enhance the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> Breakthroughs in molecular biology and genetics have greatly expanded our understanding of the importance of the diet in turning on and off our genes. In particular, it involves new insights in understanding how the most primitive part of our immune system responds to certain nutrients. Even more important is how our diet can further alter the expression of our genes for several generations through the new knowledge of &#x201c;epigenetics.&#x201d; Epigenetics is like the cloud in the world of computers. It controls the expression of our genes and is strongly influenced by our environment, in particular our diet. More important, epigenetics explains how chemical markers can be left on our genes that can be amplified and transmitted to the next generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Zone idea remains at the cutting edge of nutritional science because new discoveries keep adding depth to my basic concept. I first described the use of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids for anti-inflammatory control in The OmegaRx Zone, published in 2002. The Mediterranean Zone extends my basic Zone concept by describing the power of polyphenols&#x2014;the chemicals that give fruits and vegetables their color&#x2014;to further enhance the metabolic control of our genes and also to slow down the aging process.<br> &nbsp;<br> The title of this book, The Mediterranean Zone, might suggest it will cater to those who simply want to hear that eating pasta with a little more Parmesan cheese, drinking a little more red wine, adding some olive oil to your meals, or sipping a cappuccino with a piece of dark chocolate are the essence of the dietary program. In fact, the key feature of the diets in virtually every region that borders the Mediterranean Sea is not pasta but colorful carbohydrates rich in polyphenols. We finally have enough scientific sophistication to realize it is the high levels of colorful polyphenols that make the Mediterranean diet uniquely protective against aging, not the white pasta.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is divided into four parts. Part I puts the useful stuff right up front as it describes how to master the Mediterranean Zone. Part II describes the science of polyphenols. Part III describes how the industrialization of food led to an epidemic of inflammation in America that is now spreading worldwide due to globalization. Finally, Part IV describes the future that makes the concepts of the Mediterranean Zone more important than ever in reversing our current health-care crisis.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know that after reading this book, you will agree that the continued evolution of my Zone concept is more relevant today than when it was first presented nearly twenty years ago. And with the Mediterranean Zone, it gets even more delicious!<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Jasper and the Riddle of Riley&#39;s Mine</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>Hoping to strike it rich, two brothers escape an abusive father and set out on a treacherous journey to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Desperate to get away from their drunkard of a father, eleven-year-old Jasper and his older brother Melvin often talk of running away, of heading north to Alaska to chase riches beyond their wildest dreams.

S. Byatt. </b><br><br>Born a generation apart in the mid-1800s, Fortuny and Morris were seeming opposites: Fortuny a Spanish aristocrat thrilled by the sun-baked cultures of Crete and Knossos; Morris a member of the British bourgeoisie, enthralled by Nordic myths. Through their revolutionary inventions and textiles, both men inspired a new variety of art that is as striking today as when it was first conceived. In this elegant meditation, Byatt traces their genius right to the source.<br><br>Fortuny&#x2019;s Palazzo Pesaro Orfei in Venice is a warren of dark spaces imbued with the rich hues of Asia. In his attic workshop, Fortuny created intricate designs from glowing silks and velvets; in the palazzo he found &#x201c;happiness in a glittering cavern&#x201d; alongside the French model who became his wife and collaborator, including on the famous &#x201c;Delphos&#x201d; dress&#x2014;a flowing, pleated gown that evoked the era of classical Greece. <br><br> Morris&#x2019;s Red House outside London, with its Gothic turrets and secret gardens, helped inspire his stunning floral and geometric patterns; it likewise represented a coming together of life and art. But it was a &#x201c;sweet simple old place&#x201d; called Kelmscott Manor in the countryside that he loved best&#x2014;even when it became the setting for his wife&#x2019;s love affair with the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti.<br><br>Generously illustrated with the artists&#x2019; beautiful designs&#x2014;pomegranates and acanthus, peacock and vine&#x2014;among other aspects of their worlds, this marvel-filled book brings the visions and ideas of Fortuny and Morris to vivid life.</p><p><b>A.

It is an airy light, playing with the moving dark surfaces of the canals, shining on stone and marble, bringing both together in changing ways, always aquamarine. I found that an odd thing was happening to me. Every time I closed my eyes &#x2014; which I increasingly did deliberately &#x2014; I saw a very English green, a much more yellow green, composed of the light glittering on shaved lawns, and the dense green light in English woods, light vanishing into gnarled tree trunks, flickering on shadows on the layers of summer leaves. We were there to visit the civic museums, and I was very interested in the Palazzo Fortuny, the home of an artist of whom I had known almost nothing beyond the fact that he is the only living artist named by Proust in <i>A la recherche du temps perdu.</i> I grow more and more interested in polymaths in the arts and I have always admired those whose lives and arts are indistinguishable from each other. And as I grow older I become more and more interested in craftsmen &#x2014; glass-blowers, potters, makers of textiles. My own ancestors were potters in the English pottery towns &#x2014; the Five Towns in Staffordshire.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I grow older, also, I have come to understand that my writing&#x2014; fiction and thinking &#x2014;starts with a moment of sudden realisation that two things I have been thinking about separately are parts of the same thought, the same work. I think, fancifully perhaps, that the excitement is the excitement of the neurones in the brain, pushing out synapses connecting the web of dendrites, two movements becoming one. Every time I thought about Fortuny in the aquamarine clarity, I found I was also thinking about the Englishman William Morris. I was using Morris, whom I did know, to understand Fortuny. I was using Fortuny to reimagine Morris. Aquamarine, gold green. English meadows, Venetian canals. When I came back to England and started thinking about Morris, visiting the museums that were the houses where he had lived and worked, I closed my eyes and found my head full of aquamarine light, water flowing in canals, the dark of the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> They were both men of genius and extraordinary energy. They created their own surroundings, changed the visual world around them, studied the forms of the past and made them parts of new forms. In many ways they were opposites. Morris was an English bourgeois whose father had made an unexpected fortune in tin mining. He became a convinced and passionate socialist. Fortuny came from an aristocratic Spanish family of painters and artists and lived in an elegant aristocratic world. Fortuny&#x2019;s imaginative roots were Mediterranean &#x2014; North Africa, Crete and Delphos. Morris was obsessed by the North and the Nordic &#x2014; the Icelandic sagas, Iceland itself, the North Sea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Mariano Fortuny was born in Granada in 1871. His father, Mariano Fortuny y Marsal, was a distinguished painter, and his mother, Cecilia de Madrazo, came also from a family of artists, architects and critics. Fortuny y Marsal died of malaria when he was only thirty-six years old &#x2014; his collections of pottery, armour, textiles and carpets, as well as his paintings and etchingsere an essential part of Fortuny&#x2019;s life and work. After his father&#x2019;s death his mother moved to Paris, where her brother Raimundo was a celebrated portrait painter: the family moved in a world of artists and writers. In 1889 the family moved to Venice &#x2014; partly, at least, because Fortuny was allergic to horses, and suffered from asthma and hay fever. There they lived in the Palazzo Martinengo on the Grand Canal until Fortuny bought the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei in 1899. The move was partly because his mother did not approve of his companion, a French divorcee, Henriette Negrin, whom he met in Paris and who joined him in Venice in 1902, and whom he married in 1924.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Morris was born in 1834, of Welsh ancestry, in Walthamstow in a family with no aesthetic interests. He was sent to a preparatory school at the age of nine &#x2014; he referred to it as a &#x2018;boy farm&#x2019; &#x2014; and to Marlborough College at the age of fourteen where he was desperately unhappy but stoical. He was able to do what he liked best, which was roam in the surrounding countryside. At home he developed a passion for Epping Forest, &#x2018;certainly the biggest hornbeam wood in these islands, and I suppose in the world&#x2019;. He loved the hornbeams, &#x2018;magnificently grotesque&#x2019; as his splendid biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, puts it, and later fought to save the forest from development. He also developed a passion for churches and for the River Thames. When he went to Oxford he became part of a group of friends, including Edward Burne- Jones, who were interested in early church architecture &#x2014; they were the Set and became the Brotherhood. The second volume of Ruskin&#x2019;s The Stones of Venice, published in 1853 was, MacCarthy says, &#x201c;an Oxford book, the Oxford book, of that whole period when the reading of Ruskin seemed to Morris to have been a &#x201c;sort of revelation&#x201d;&#x2019;. In 1857 he met Jane Burden whom he married in 1859. Jane was the daughter of a stable hand, who had been discovered in a theatre by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Burne-Jones, who collected what they called &#x2018;stunners&#x2019;, women of striking and unusual beauty. Morris&#x2019;s marriage was not happy &#x2014; Janey fell in love with Rossetti, for whom she posed, and with whom she had a long affair, about which Morris, a man capable of violent rages, was generous and tolerant. When, in 1871, Morris and Rossetti took a joint tenancy of Kelmscott Manor, Morris set off for Iceland leaving Rossetti and Jane together in Kelmscott with Morris&#x2019;s two daughters, a gesture, MacCarthy says, which verged on the sublime.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Fortuny was happily married to Henriette, with whom he had lived for twenty-two years before the marriage. She was his partner in all his work.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> I found I was musing on the two worlds, Venetian and English, seen through the images of the women who inhabited them. Morris himself was not essentially interested in painting &#x2014; he cared for objects, for solid things. He made one painting of Jane in the summer and winter of 1857-8, a tall, slightly gawky woman in pink and white medieval costume, standing unsmiling beside a rumpled bed in which a small hound is sleeping. He is said to have written on it &#x2018;I cannot paint you, but I love you&#x2019;. In 1858, in a poem &#x2018;Praise of My Lady&#x2019;, he described her as something with the lifeless quality of ivory and metal. Her hair was &#x2018;thick and crisped wonderfully&#x2019; dark and &#x2018;dead&#x2019; as if forged &#x2018;Of some strange metal, thread by thread&#x2019;. Rossetti started to paint her in the 1860s, over and over again, always with the same large, red, hungry, mournful mouth, distant staring eyes, and rich melancholy mass of hair. <i>The Blue Silk Dress</i> was painted in 1868 as a commission from Morris. Jane made the dress herself &#x2014; Rossetti wrote to suggest that the sleeves should be &#x2018;full at the top&#x2019; &#x2014; and Jane&#x2019;s daughter May remembered it as &#x2018;a delicious, simple silk gown of shot blue and brown that was a favourite with the little girls&#x2019;. In this painting Jane&#x2019;s nervously twisted hands display a wedding ring. In later paintings it is not there. There is something appalling, I have discovered, in looking at a whole series of Rossetti&#x2019;s images, more and more obsessive yet essentially all the same, brooding, dangerous, sexually greedy, too much. The best, and therefore the worst, is Proserpine where the brooding figure grasps the pomegranate with a bite in it, condemning her to a season in Hades. I wondered two things about this succession &#x2014; are they the product of Rossetti&#x2019;s own disturbed imagination, or did Jane really look like that? And what effect did these images of Rossetti&#x2019;s feelings have on Morris, as they hung in his house or were bought by others?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Photographs of Jane Morris are remarkably like the paintings. Rossetti commissioned a series of photographic portraits of Jane, taken in his own garden by John Robert Parsons. The face is recognisably the face of the painted woman, unsmiling, melancholy, malcontent, beautiful. Her dresses are loose, artistic. I do not have any idea at all of what she was really like. Attempts have been made, mostly by women writers, to give her a separate identity, to make as much as possible of her skilled embroidery. But she remains alien, until in old age her hair is white and her expression resigned rather than desperate.<br><br> Henry James describes meeting her in 1868.<br><br> <i>Imagine a tall, lean woman in a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of hoops (or of anything else I should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples, a thin pale face, a pair of strange sad, deep dark Swinburnian eyes, with great thick black oblique brows � a long neck, without any collar, and in lieu thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads &#x2014; in fine complete. On the wall was a large, nearly full-length portrait of her by Rossetti, so strange and unreal that if you hadn&#x2019;t seen her you&#x2019;d pronounce it a distempered vision, but in fact an extremely good likeness. After dinner � Morris read us one of his unpublished poems, from the second series of his un-&#x2018;Earthly Paradise,&#x2019; and his wife, having a bad toothache, lay on the sofa, with her handkerchief to her face. There was something very quaint and remote from our actual life, it seemed to me, in the whole scene: Morris reading in his flowing antique numbers a legend of prodigies and terrors (the story of Bellerophon, it was), around us all the picturesque bric-a-brac of the apartment (every article of furniture literally a &#x2018;specimen&#x2019; of something or other) and in the corner this dark silent medieval woman with her medieval toothache.</i><br> <br> A (to me) completely unexpected and surprising collector of Rossetti&#x2019;s paintings of women was the English painter L.S. Lowry, whose own world consists of dark sticklike figures moving in urban landscapes. In an interview with Mervyn Levy he said:<br><br> <i>I don&#x2019;t like his women at all, but they fascinate me, like a snake. That&#x2019;s why I always buy Rossetti whenever I can. His women are really rather horrible. It&#x2019;s like a friend of mine who says he hates my work, although it fascinates him.</i><br> <br> The friend Lowry referred to was businessman Monty Bloom, to whom he also explained his obsession with Rossetti&#x2019;s portraits:<br><br> <i>They are not real women ... They are dreams ... He used them for something in his mind caused by the death of his wife. I may be quite wrong there, but significantly they all came after the death of his wife.</i><br> <br> The uneasiness aroused in me by the images of Morris&#x2019;s wife is compounded by the proliferation of cartoon drawings of Morris himself by his friends, both Burne-Jones and Rossetti. Janey is swooning and elegant: Morris is squat, fat, urgent and ridiculous. There is an exemplary caricature by Burne-Jones of &#x2018;William Morris attending his wife who lays upon a couch&#x2019;. There is a drawing by Rossetti of �Mrs Morris and the Wombat&#x2019; in which Morris is a small woolly creature (with a halo) held on a leash by proud, tormented Janey. Taken altogether these caricatures are a form of cruelty, I think, which I imagine Morris was expected to smile at and endure. He was, as I have said, known for violent rages, breaking of chairs and cutlery<br> &#x2014; but I have seen no record of his objecting to these demeaning clever drawings. (See for instance Burne-Jones&#x2019;s representations of Morris at the loom, or climbing a mountain in Iceland.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> I don&#x2019;t think I should ever have clarified these thoughts and feelings if I had not simultaneously been trying to imagine Fortuny&#x2019;s domestic life in the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> The first image most of us see of Fortuny, frequently reproduced, is of an imposing bearded face, under a turban, over a flowing gown &#x2014; a magician from the Arabian Nights. He lived in a world of elegant parties, extravagant theatricals, carnival and opulence. His domestic history, and his many images of his wife, are not quite what we expect. The relationship appears to have deepened slowly &#x2014; they met from time to time in Paris until they decided that Henriette would join Fortuny in 1902. They arrived in Venice on the day on which the campanile of San Marco collapsed, which Fortuny&#x2019;s mother took as a bad omen. They lived together in the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei which Fortuny reconstructed for their workshop, studio and living space. In 1906 Arthur Evans discovered ancient fabrics during excavations in Crete &#x2014; I shall come back to these &#x2014; and Fortuny and Henriette decided together to make new fabrics in these old forms. She was his partner and collaborator both in the revolutionary pleated fabrics, and in the dyeing, stencilling and printing of new silk, velvet and cotton fabrics. We are told that they lived austerely and simply in their palace-workshop, with Henriette making the beds, and washing up after meals. During all their time together Fortuny made images&nbsp;of Henriette, paintings, photographs, drawings &#x2014; there is a wonderful charcoal drawing of a young Henriette, with a mass of dark hair, now in the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid. She is a beautiful woman certainly, with an elegant face and hands. In the paintings particularly she has a questioning, thoughtful look, at once holding back and open. She is not voluptuous &#x2014; she is what the French would describe as <i>bien dans sa peau.</i> What is striking about these repeated images &#x2014; whether they were painted in 1915 or 1930 &#x2014; is the feeling the painter seems to have for the model. He isn&#x2019;t particularly painting desire &#x2014; he is painting both love and liking &#x2014; this is a face he knows intimately, and cares about. There is a lovely photograph by Fortuny of Henriette in a working overall in the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei, bent over an engraved wooden block she is colouring for printing silk or velvet. And in the Museo Fortuny today there is a group of paintings hanging on a wall in the salon, a family collection, of portraits of Henriette and a self-portrait of Fortuny. Morris&#x2019;s domesticity was tormented, however generously he tried to accommodate his wife&#x2019;s needs and nerves. Fortuny seems to have created domestic calm and happiness in a glittering cavern.</p><h2>Loba (Penguin Poets)</h2><p><b>Loba</b> is a visionary epic quest for the reintegration of the femimine, hailed by many as the great female counterpart to Allen Ginsberg's Howl when the first half appeared in 1978.

The illustrations of Beatrix Potter and N. C. Wyeth were early favorites, and I always found any kind of animal story irresistible. I was an enthusiastic young artist as well, and I formulated pre-school plans to make drawing the center of my lifetime career. I used to dream up stories and illustrate them for my younger sisters, Patti and Martha. We called the activity: "Telling Stories on Paper." When it took place, I would sit between them with a stack of paper on my lap and a pencil in my hand, rattling off tales and scribbling illustrations to accompany them, and passing the pictures first to one of the girls and then to the other. I enjoyed these storytelling sessions enormously and I usually persevered until my sisters were too restless to sit there any longer, or until they were buried under pieces ofpaper.<p>I scribbled my way through elementary, junior- and senior-high school, and afterward I attended the Rhode Island School of Design, where I majored in illustration, and where I was particularly intrigued by the few projects we were given that related to the creation of picture books. I wasfortunate enough to win a fellowship that made possible a senior year of work and study in Florence, Italy. It was an exciting and fulfilling period for me, and I find that I draw constantly on the experience and images that I stored during my time there.</p><p>Upon my return to the United States I did some graduate work and teaching at American University, and at the same time I began submitting picture book ideas to various publishers. Itwas an exciting moment when the first acceptances came in, and I realized that I would be able to "tell stories on paper" full-time and to a much larger audience. I loved the challenge of putting the first books together, guiding them through the various stages of the publishing process, and thenwatching them disperse into the lives of their readers. And now, twenty-five years and almost ninety books later, I still find every aspect of my involvement just as absorbing andenjoyable.</p><p>During the time that I've been working on the picture books, I've lived in an old farmhouse in the hills of Connecticut which I've shared with my wife, Helen, and where I've raised six stepchildren, to whom most of my books are dedicated. Also in residence have been numerous dogs and cats, including a beloved harlequin Great Dane named Pinkerton, whose stubborn inadaptability during puppyhood inspired the book <b>Pinkerton, Behave!</b> The heroine of the sequel, <b>ARose for Pinkerton</b>, was our senior cat, Secondhand Rose, an independent old grouch who was born a wild thing in the Catskill Mountains, and who devoted her long life to harassing everyone in the world, including Pinkerton.</p><p>The ideas for the other books come from lots of different sources, but most of them have their roots in feelings and images that I retain from my own childhood. I try to blend illustrations and the words so that each book is a feast for the eye and ear. I want the time that the reader shares with me and my work to be an enjoyable experience -- one that will encourage a lifetimeassociation with pictures, words, and books.</p><p><b>Steven Kellogg talks about the art of the picturebook<br></b>The picture book is an art form that is designed specifically for children, but I feel that it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all ages. For centuries a distinguished tradition of illustrated books and manuscripts has existed of which the picture book is a part. It is a synthesis of literature and the visual arts, and the relationship of the written word and the picture is its essence.I am fascinated by the ways in which the picture book can borrow and combine diverse elements from other art forms to achieve startling and moving effects.</p><p>The turning page, for example, gives the illustrator the chance to utilize the elements of surprise to advance the movement of the story, and to deepen the involvement of the viewer in much the same way that the theatrical director uses the revolving stages or the rising curtain between thescenes and acts of a play.</p><p>An awareness of movement is extremely important in the conception of a picture book. My favorite illustrators delineate their characters so that animation is implied. The individual spreads are designed so that they crackle with graphic vitality. The characters seem to speak, cavort, andleap from the page so energetically that their life and movement are totally convincing. The moving qualities of each picture are heightened by the placement of the turning pages within the unfolding narrative and by the conception of the book as a whole. It is here that one sees the relationship between the arts of picture book design and filmmaking, as both of them deal with thephenomenon of "moving pictures."</p><p>No one will deny that language can be musical, and certainly visual images can suggest different forms of music by the feelings that they convey. The musical qualities of the pictures and the words can be orchestrated by the artist as he moves them across the pages of the book. Rhythms and harmonies can be established on some spreads, and atonal effects or dissonances can be introduced on others.</p><p>There are limitless possibilities available to the artist, who sets up relationships and tensionsbetween the illustrations and the text, allowing magical discoveries and subtle revelations to emerge in the areas between. When this happens, there is an uncanny fusion of all the elements,and the dynamic new expression that is created introduces young readers to the world of art.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

He has worked on over 200 books, sometimes as illustrator and sometimes as the writer too. In 1999, with the help of children from over 24 schools all over Britain, Quentin was selected to be the first Children's Laureate. The children submitted a long list of questions for Quentin, here are his answers to a few of them.</p><p>"<i>Your illustrations are very recognizable. What made you illustrate the way you do?</i>"<br>"I am not really quite sure why I draw the way I do. It may be because I didn&#x2019;t go to an art school, except for part-time lessons when I was already over twenty. But I don&#x2019;t think that can be the whole explanation. It&#x2019;s a kind of handwriting, and it does actually look rather like my handwriting."</p><p>"<i>Did you first start to like books because of the words or the pictures? Do you like writing as much as drawing and painting? In <b>Clown</b> you didn&#x2019;t use words at all. Do you think stories can be told as well without words?</i>"<br>"I also enjoy writing words; though I think that sometimes it&#x2019;s possible to tell a story entirely in pictures, as in <b>Clown</b>. One interesting thing about that is that it gives the reader the opportunity to invent words and I think it encourages you to think about, and perhaps discuss, what actually is going on and what the characters are thinking and feeling."</p><p>"<i>When we read we make up pictures in our heads. Do you think having lots of pictures in a book helps that or stops it happening?</i>"<br>"This raises a very interesting question. With my pictures, what I hope is that it encourages the reader to imagine more pictures of his own. But sometimes what the writer is putting into your head is so rich and visual that much in the way of illustration is superfluous. Probably you know the answer to this question (though I don&#x2019;t think there is only one answer) better than I do."</p><p>"<i>How did you feel when they announced the winner of the Children&#x2019;s Laureate? Will it help your work or get in the way? What do you want to be able to do now that you are Children&#x2019;s Laureate?</i>"<br>"When I was told that I was winner of the Children&#x2019;s Laureate I experienced quite a variety of thoughts and feelings. It was very gratifying to think that a lot of people (like you) really did like what I had done - it was an unmistakable sign of something that it is very difficult to imagine from inside yourself. At the same time I was aware of the problem (so are the organisers of the Laureateship) that, if I am not careful, it might distract me from the work of creating more books, which is what I do best. However, for a long time I was a teacher of illustration at The Royal College of Art, so I know something about how to do two jobs at once; and I hope that during my two years I shall be offered, or find, ways to encourage people to discuss words and pictures and the way they go together; and generally to rate children&#x2019;s books at their true value."</p><p>"<i>Have you any advice you can give us?</i>"<br>"Well, difficult; because everyone is different. But I do know that, whether it is writing or drawing, you have to do a lot of it, and keep on doing it - that is the way to improvement. And don&#x2019;t wait for inspiration, just start. Inspiration is some mysterious blessing which happens when the wheels are turning smoothly."</p><p>"At the moment I am at work on a book about my work and the way I do it. When it comes out - it won&#x2019;t be before September 2000, I&#x2019;m afraid - you may find in it more extended answers to your questions; I will try to make sure they are there!"</p><p>Quentin Blake has illustrated many of Roald Dahl's books, in addition to other books for children. He lives in London, England.<br>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.</p><p>Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years.</p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>.</p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p>Eric Carle has two grown-up children, a son and a daughter. With his wife Barbara, he lives in Northampton, Massachusetts. The Carles spend their summers in the nearby Berkshire hills.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Group (USA) Books for Young Readers.

His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.</p><p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration.</p><p>Tomie dePaola has published almost 200 children's books in fifteen different countries. He remains one of the most popular creators of books for children, receiving more than 100,000 fan letters each year.</p><p>Tomie lives in an in...</p>The title says it all in this anthology of inspirational letters written by 23 contemporary children&#x2019;s-book illustrators to future artists. A multicultural group with amazingly diverse artistic styles, the featured illustrators are some of the best-known and celebrated in the genre, including Mitsumasa Anno, Quentin Blake, Nancy Ekholm Burkert, Eric Carle, Tomie de Paola, Steve Kellogg, Leo Lionni, Petra Mathers, Barry Moser, Jerry Pinkney, Alice Provensen, Maurice Sendak, Chris Van Allsburg, Genady Spirin, Rosemary Wells and Paul O. Zelinksy. Their diversity shines in the text of their letters, in which they share childhood stories, sources of inspiration, views on art, details of how they work and advice on becoming an artist. Opposite each illustrator&#x2019;s letter, a nifty fold-out page presents a montage of &#x201c;images, art, works-in-progress, photographs of studios and work spaces as well as each artist&#x2019;s wonderful self-portrait.&#x201d; Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart&#x2019;s collaborative self-portrait appropriately resides in one of their pop-ups. Fun to read and view, this anthology is a treasure trove of creative insight and inspiration. Perfect for libraries, art teachers, budding artists and fans of children&#x2019;s-book illustration.<b> &#x2014;Kirkus, starred review</b><p>This anthology celebrates and elucidates contemporary picture-book art, particularly that which has been exhibited at the Eric Carle Museum. An introduction (and entry) is penned by Carle himself; an afterword from the museum director highlights the institution&#x2019;s mission of nurturing young artists. Ashley Bryan, Quentin Blake, Leo Lionni, Alice Provensen, and Gennady Spirin are among the contributors, whose comments are formatted as signed letters, illustrated with childhood photographs. The missives speak of early stirrings of creativity, struggles with school, the importance of mentors, the joy of living a passion. Each artist includes glorious self-portraits and a gatefold page that reveals a marvelous array of sketches, color mixes, and studio scenes. All readers will find something that piques curiosity or provides insight: a page from Tomie dePaola&#x2019;s first picture book (1965); Jerry Pinkney&#x2019;s cowboy model and horse substitute; Paul Zelinsky&#x2019;s sequential panels depicting the Renaissance-inspired technique used for Rapunzel and his portrait. While there is some overlap with Pat Cummings&#x2019;s &#x201c;Talking with Artists&#x201d; series (S &amp; S), there are no framing questions, so the illustrators ruminate freely. Sendak writes about finding &#x201c;a space in the text so that the pictures can do the work.&#x201d; Sabuda (whose portrait is a pop-up) envisions a &#x201c;dance across the page.&#x201d; Brief biographies and bibliographies conclude the title. A selective work, by nature, results in omissions, and there are some surprising absences. Yet, the end result is a gorgeous, browsable gallery of international treasures, with a behind-the-scenes tour led by the generous and gifted creators themselves. &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>Rising to the Call</h2><p><p>Facet by facet this internationally acclaimed Christian thinker examines life and the universal search for its meaning.

The eighth edition&#39;s coverage includes discussion of such events and issues as Barack Obama&#39;s presidency, the presidential primaries and election of 2016, the battle over equality among national politicians in 2016, and many issues facing social agencies. By going beyond the traditional foundational approach to policy, this text helps you develop the skills you need to become an advocate for social change. It offers you practical guidance on how to develop social media campaigns, and discusses ways you can participate in reducing inequality -- the issue that drew the attention of millions of millennials in the presidential election of 2016.</p><p>Bruce S. Jansson (M.A., University of Chicago and Harvard University; Ph.D., University of Chicago) is the Driscoll/Clevenger Professor of Social Policy in the Department of Social Work at the University of Southern California (USC). He joined the USC faculty in 1973 after working in Pennsylvania and Michigan as a community organizer and planner for tenant rights. His scholarly interests focus on advancing mezzo, micro and macro policy advocacy in social work, as well as examining the history and practice of social welfare policy. Dr. Jansson invented the term &#34;policy practice,&#34; which has become a required content area by the Council on Social Work Education.

And the more "clients", he figured, the more money -- and more people eager to see him dead. So no one is surprised when the pigeon is found floating in the East River with his skull bashed in. And what's worse, no one cares -- except Matthew Scudder. The ex-cop-turned-private-eye is no conscientious avenging angel. But he's willing to risk his own life and limb to confront Spinner's most murderously aggressive marks. A job's a job after all -- and Scudder's been paid to find a killer -- by the victim...in advance.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre.

In The Sins of the Fathers (1992/1976), Stephen King waxed on about the alcoholic p.i.'s cases; this one comes with an equally flattering introduction by Jonathan Kellerman, though the story's not as good--a relatively pat, if pungently saturnine, tale of blackmail and murder. As with many reprints of aged paperbacks (e.g., Bill Pronzini's Carmody's Run, p. 554), period-piece value outweighs the literary here. This Scudder is very 70's; boozing his days and nights away; casually bribing cops for the price of a ``hat'' ($25); willing--thanks to his (and the era's) ignorance about child molestation--to let a pederast go free. The case itself has a classic setup: A small-time hood hires Scudder to guard a package; when the hood turns up dead, Scudder opens the package to find four envelopes, three of them holding blackmail evidence--one on an ``architectural consultant'' with pockets deep enough to have bought his daughter off a manslaughter charge; another on a society wife with a secret prostitute past; the third on a would-be state governor with a yen for young boys. The fourth envelope contains $4,000 and a request that Scudder find the hood's murderer among the three. The p.i. visits each suspect, pretending to be their new blackmailer. Soon, two near-miss attempts--by car and by knife--are made on his life; then one suspect kills himself: case closed? Scudder thinks so, until an unexpected third attack sends him on a drunken bender and onto the trail of suspect number two: case closed? Not likely, in Scudder/Block's darkly ironic world. More than paperback hack work, but special only to die-hard Scudder fans--and for glimmers of what was to come. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The essays gathered here are wide-ranging and essential and include representative pieces from some of Deloria's most influential books, some of his lesser-known articles, and ten new pieces written especially for <i>Spirit &amp; Reason</i>.<br><br> Tellingly, in the course of reviewing his body of work, Deloria found much that he had written in the past remained current and compelling because "people have not made much progress in resolving issues." Whether disputing theories of religion and science, examining the problems of modern education, or expounding on our understanding of the world, Deloria consistently urges readers toward an intimate connection with the world in which we live.

What is the basis for a relationship between the church and visual imagery? Can the art world and the Protestant church be reconciled? Is art idolatry and vanity, or can it be used to strengthen the church? Grounded in historical and biblical research, William Dyrness offers students and scholars an intriguing, substantive look into the relationship between the church and the world of art.<br><br>Faith and art were not always discordant. According to Dyrness, Israel understood imagery and beauty as reflections of God's perfect order; likewise, early Christians used art to teach and inspire. However, the Protestant church abandoned visual arts and imagery during the Reformation in favor of the written word and has only recently begun to reexamine art's role in Christianity and worship. Dyrness affirms this renewal and argues that art, if reflecting the order and wholeness of the world God created, can and should play an important role in modern Christianity.</p><p>"Both theological and practical, this wide-ranging study will be of special interest to all who want to get beyond the sterile prejudices that have so often marred the relationship between visual art and Protestantism."<br>-Jeremy Begbie, Cambridge University and University of St. Andrews<br><br>"Dyrness advocates 'careful historical and theological reflection' and puts this into practice in ways that satisfy the academic mind. Most of all, however, he emerges as a theologian of the arts with a message for the churches. He offers a well-founded critique of traditional Protestant prejudice against matters visual and artistic, and he issues an inspiring challenge to follow the Spirit into richer modes of praise and worship."<br>-Graham Birtwistle, Free University, Amsterdam<br><br>"A refreshing and welcome addition to the growing discourse on a Protestant recovery of visual imagination and the need for Christians of all stripes to engage and exploit the visual arts-both in the secular marketplace and within the worshiping life of the church."<br>-E. John Walford, Wheaton College<br><br>"The image-oriented insularity found in certain sectors of the Protestant church is sensitively and thoughtfully challenged by Bill Dyrness in this insightful guide. <i>Visual Faith </i>weaves together a compelling case for the collaboration between art and Christianity. Placing the complex world of contemporary art making within historical, theological, and cultural contexts, Dyrness affirms the necessity of images in the ongoing vitality of the church and her mission."<br>-Barry Krammes, Biola University; <br>publications editor, <i>Christians in the Visual Arts</i><br><br>"With economy, grace, and passion, <i>Visual Faith </i>provides a compelling case for a deeper engagement on the part of Reformed Christians with visual art and aesthetics. Without apologizing for the past, Dyrness chronicles the astonishing renaissance of Christian involvement in contemporary art that is taking place in the present. And by placing art in the context of worship and the rich variety of other Christian traditions of spirituality and theology, he is helping to shape the future."<br>-Gregory Wolfe, editor, <i>Image: A Journal of the Arts &amp; Religion</i><br><br>"This is a book that church leaders, artists, and worshipers all need to read and discuss together. It contributes insights that are vital to understanding and shaping (both critically and constructively) major changes in culture and worship today."<br>-Frank Burch Brown, Christian TheologicalWilliam A.

This volume of plays, translated from the Italian by Mark Musa, opens with <i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i>, in which six characters invade the stage and demand to be included in the play. The tragedy <i>Henry IV</i> dramatizes the lucid madness of a man who may be King. In <i>So It Is (If You Think So)</i>, the townspeople exercise a morbid curiosity attempting to discover &#x201c;the truth&#x201d; about the Ponza family. Each of these plays can lay claim to being Pirandello&#x2019;s masterpiece, and in exploring the nature of human personality, each one stretches the resources of drama to their limits.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

As a young man he studied at the Universities of Palermo, Rome, and Bonn, where he gained his doctorate in 1891. His first published work,&nbsp;<i>Mal giocondo</i>&nbsp;(1889), was a collection of poems. It was followed by other volumes of poems, critical essays, novels, short stories, and over forty plays. In 1894 he married Antoinetta Portulano, the daughter of his father&#x2019;s business associate. Financial disaster and a severe illness brought on by the birth of their third child drove his wife to a hysterical form of insanity. Only in 1918, when her presence in the family constituted a real threat to their daughter&#x2019;s safety did Pirandello agree to have his wife committed to an asylum. The enormous emotional strain he felt at this time is reflected in the intense pessimism found in his work. Pirandello&#x2019;s first real success in the theatre came about in 1921 when&nbsp;<i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i>&nbsp;was performed.&nbsp;<i>Henry IV</i>&nbsp;followed the next year and confirmed his position as a playwright. In the following years Pirandello travelled abroad extensively. He embarked on a career as a producer and in 1925 founded his Art Theatre in Rome. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934 and died in Rome.<br><br> <b>Mark Musa</b>&nbsp;(1934&#x2013;2014) was a professor at the Center for Italian Studies at Indiana University. A former Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellow, Musa authored a highly acclaimed translation of Dante&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Divine Comedy</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Sex and the Constitution: Sex, Religion, and Law from America&#39;s Origins to the Twenty-First Century</h2><p><p><strong>There has never been a book like <em>Sex and the Constitution</em>, a one-volume history that chapter after chapter overturns popular shibboleths, while dramatically narrating the epic story of how sex came to be legislated in America.</strong></p><p>Beginning his volume in the ancient and medieval worlds, Geoffrey R. Stone demonstrates how the Founding Fathers, deeply influenced by their philosophical forebears, saw traditional Christianity as an impediment to the pursuit of happiness and to the quest for human progress. Acutely aware of the need to separate politics from the divisive forces of religion, the Founding Fathers crafted a constitution that expressed the fundamental values of the Enlightenment.</p><p>Although the Second Great Awakening later came to define America through the lens of evangelical Christianity, nineteenth-century Americans continued to view sex as a matter of private concern, so much so that sexual expression and information about contraception circulated freely, abortions before &#x201c;quickening&#x201d; remained legal, and prosecutions for sodomy were almost nonexistent.</p><p>The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reversed such tolerance, however, as charismatic spiritual leaders and barnstorming politicians rejected the values of our nation&#x2019;s founders. Spurred on by Anthony Comstock, America&#x2019;s most feared enforcer of morality, new laws were enacted banning pornography, contraception, and abortion, with Comstock proposing that the word &#x201c;unclean&#x201d; be branded on the foreheads of homosexuals. Women increasingly lost control of their bodies, and birth control advocates, like Margaret Sanger, were imprisoned for advocating their beliefs. In this new world, abortions were for the first time relegated to dank and dangerous back rooms.</p><p>The twentieth century gradually saw the emergence of bitter divisions over issues of sexual &#x201c;morality&#x201d; and sexual freedom. Fiercely determined organizations and individuals on both the right and the left wrestled in the domains of politics, religion, public opinion, and the courts to win over the soul of the nation. With its stirring portrayals of Supreme Court justices, <em>Sex and the Constitution</em> reads like a dramatic gazette of the critical cases they decided, ranging from <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em> (contraception), to <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (abortion), to <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> (gay marriage), with Stone providing vivid historical context to the decisions that have come to define who we are as a nation.</p><p>Now, though, after the 2016 presidential election, we seem to have taken a huge step backward, with the progress of the last half century suddenly imperiled. No one can predict the extent to which constitutional decisions safeguarding our personal freedoms might soon be eroded, but <em>Sex and the Constitution</em> is more vital now than ever before.</p> 50 photographs</p><p>Geoffrey R. Stone is the author of the prize-winning Perilous Times. He is the Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago and one of our nation&#x2019;s leading constitutional scholars.&#x201c;Writing confidently and expertly about several centuries of American laws regulating sex, Stone shows that the line between moral and religious reasoning was almost always illusory. . . . <em>Sex and the Constitution</em> is most persuasive when Stone turns to America, and his comprehensive knowledge of constitutional law is put on full display. He is especially good on the eighteenth century, bringing a bracing and much-needed dose of reality about the Founders&#x2019; views of sexuality. . . .

Middleton and Dekker's 'roaring girl'<br>may outrage her society with her pipe, bluster and swagger, but she<br>turns out to be the moral centre of the play. Her code of honour leads<br>her to call the bluff on rogues and conspicuous consumers, to thrash a<br>hypocritical gallant in a duel, and to act as go-between for the young<br>lovers thwarted by parental tyranny. This wry dramatisation of female<br>deviancy exposing male ineffectuality is as much to the point today as<br>it was in King James's England.

In <i>Why They Can't Write</i>, John Warner, who taught writing at the college level for two decades, argues that the problem isn't caused by a lack of rigor, or smartphones, or some generational character defect. Instead, he asserts, we're teaching writing wrong. </p><p>Warner blames this on decades of educational reform rooted in standardization, assessments, and accountability. We have done no more, Warner argues, than conditioned students to perform "writing-related simulations," which pass temporary muster but do little to help students develop their writing abilities. This style of teaching has made students passive and disengaged. Worse yet, it hasn't prepared them for writing in the college classroom. Rather than making choices and thinking critically, as writers must, undergraduates simply follow the rules&#x2015;such as the five-paragraph essay&#x2015;designed to help them pass these high-stakes assessments.</p><p>In <i>Why They Can't Write</i>, Warner has crafted both a diagnosis for what ails us and a blueprint for fixing a broken system. Combining current knowledge of what works in teaching and learning with the most enduring philosophies of classical education, this book challenges readers to develop the skills, attitudes, knowledge, and habits of mind of strong writers.</p></p><p><p>An important challenge to what currently masquerades as conventional wisdom regarding the teaching of writing.</p><p><b>John Warner (MOUNT PLEASANT, SC)</b> is a columnist for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, a contributing blogger for <i>Inside Higher Education</i>, and an editor at large for <i>McSweeney's Internet Tendency</i>.

Although history makes clear that political structures can be used for destructive ends, it also demonstrates their importance in ensuring the peace needed for prosperity. In this revised edition, Bates strengthens his critique of development studies and development agencies, basing it on his analysis of the nature of states that emerged following WWII.</p><p>Robert H. Bates is Eaton Professor of the Science of Government in the Department of Government and Fellow of the Center for International Development at Harvard University. He has written numerous books, most recently Open Economy Politics (1997) and Analytic Narratives (1998). He has conducted extensive field research in East and Central Africa and in Columbia and Brazil.January PublicationsRobert H. Bates is Eaton Professor of the Science of Government and fellow of the Center for International Development at Harvard University. In Prosperity and Violence: The Political Economy of Development, a thoughtful and instructive book, he examines how underdeveloped societies progress from agrarian to industrial states by examining how governments foster investment and per capita growth and how they manage their political power and use of force. Drawing on the history of highly developed countries, such as those in Europe, Bates compares them with developing countries in Latin America and Africa. For example, he finds in Kenya a government and an economic organization working collaboratively toward prosperity, which he contrasts with the militaristic, economically destructive situation in Uganda. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Black Reconstruction in America (The Oxford W. E. B. Du Bois): An Essay Toward a History of the Part Which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880</h2><p>W. E. B. Du Bois was a public intellectual, sociologist, and activist on behalf of the African American community. He profoundly shaped black political culture in the United States through his founding role in the NAACP, as well as internationally through the Pan-African movement. Du Bois's sociological and historical research on African-American communities and culture broke ground in many areas, including the history of the post-Civil War Reconstruction period. Du Bois was also a prolific author of novels, autobiographical accounts, innumerable editorials and journalistic pieces, and several works of history.<br><br><em>Black Reconstruction in America</em> tells and interprets the story of the twenty years of Reconstruction from the point of view of newly liberated African Americans. Though lambasted by critics at the time of its publication in 1935, Black Reconstruction has only grown in historical and literary importance. In the 1960s it joined the canon of the most influential revisionist historical works. Its greatest achievement is weaving a credible, lyrical historical narrative of the hostile and politically fraught years of 1860-1880 with a powerful critical analysis of the harmful effects of democracy, including Jim Crow laws and other injustices. With a series introduction by editor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and an introduction by David Levering Lewis, this edition is essential for anyone interested in African American history.<br></p><p>This pioneering work was the first full-length study of the role black Americans played in the crucial period after the Civil War, when the slaves had been freed and the attempt was made to reconstruct American society.<br><strong>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</strong>, is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the W.

In fact, the author argues, the relationship between the anthropologist and his object of study is a particular instance of the relationship between knowing and doing, interpreting and using, symbolic mastery and practical mastery&#x2015;or between logical logic, armed with all the accumulated instruments of objectification, and the universally pre-logical logic of practice.<br>In this, his fullest statement of a theory of practice, Bourdieu both sets out what might be involved in incorporating one's own standpoint into an investigation and develops his understanding of the powers inherent in the second member of many oppositional pairs&#x2015;that is, he explicates how the practical concerns of daily life condition the transmission and functioning of social or cultural forms.<br>The first part of the book, "Critique of Theoretical Reason," covers more general questions, such as the objectivization of the generic relationship between social scientific observers and their objects of study, the need to overcome the gulf between subjectivism and objectivism, the interplay between structure and practice (a phenomenon Bourdieu describes via his concept of the <i>habitus</i>), the place of the body, the manipulation of time, varieties of symbolic capital, and modes of domination.<br>The second part of the book, "Practical Logics," develops detailed case studies based on Bourdieu's ethnographic fieldwork in Algeria. These examples touch on kinship patterns, the social construction of domestic space, social categories of perception and classification, and ritualized actions and exchanges.<br>This book develops in full detail the theoretical positions sketched in Bourdieu's <i>Outline of a Theory of Practice</i>. It will be especially useful to readers seeking to grasp the subtle concepts central to Bourdieu's theory, to theorists interested in his points of departure from structuralism (especially fom L�vi-Strauss), and to critics eager to understand what role his theory gives to human agency. It also reveals Bourdieu to be an anthropological theorist of considerable originality and power.</p><p>Now available in paperback, this book offers a major statement of Bourdieu's theoretical approach, illustrating it with examples from anthropology. It will consolidate his reputation as one of the most original and exciting theorists in the social sciences today. <p>Drawing on his own field work as well as a wide range of ethnographic and anthropological texts, Bourdieu unfolds a theoretical perspective which does justice to the practical logic of everyday action as well as the objective structures within which such action takes place. A thorough understanding of practice requires the anthropologist to move beyond objectivism and subjectivism and to grasp, by means of the concept of `habitus', the interplay of structures and practices in the ongoing conduct of everyday life.</p>Pierre Bourdieu was a French sociologist, anthropologist, and philosopher. <br> <br>fm.author_biographical_note2</p><h2>Complex/Archetype/Symbol in the Psychology of C.

Dr. Dooley intersperses stories from his twenty years of training and experience as he explains what homeopathy is, how it differs, when to use it, what to expect, how to get results, and what is needed for success in treatment. Highly recommended by homeopathic practitioners. <p>The second edition includes updated resources and research sections.</p></p><p>Dr. Dooley has the distinction of having both a naturopathic degree and medical degree. He graduated in 1978 from National College of Naturopathic Medicine (1978), one of the four accredited naturopathic medical schools in the United States. He returned in 1985 to Oregon Health Sciences University School of Medicine, and received his medical degree in 1989. <p>He was co-founder of Grants Pass Naturopathic Clinic in Oregon, medical director of emergency services at Del Puerto Hospital in California, and volunteered with the Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team in Mexico and India. </p><p>Dr. Dooley has been practicing homeopathy in San Diego since 1993 and has been teaching at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences since 1998.</p><i>Homeopathy: Beyond Flat Earth Medicine</i> by Timothy R. Dooley, is a gem of a book. Dooley's writing style is informal, conversational, and easy to read. Amazingly, it is mostly jargon-free with the history and philosophy woven throughout in colorful threads rather than delivered in dry, dusty chunks. The explanations are succinct and beautifully digestible. Dooley answers every question I have ever been asked about homeopathy--and many more--while describing virtually every aspect of homeopathic treatment. The chapters are sprinkled with memorable stories, anecdotes, and case histories that are invariably vivid, interesting, humourous, or entertaining--sometimes all at once. This book reminds me of my favorite teacher, who entertained and instructed in equal measure. -- <i>Miranda Castro, FS Hom, Mothering Magazine, Summer 1997</i></p><h2>Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash</h2><p>Gunter Stemberger&#39;s revision of H. L. Strack&#39;s classic introduction to rabbinic literature, which appeared in its first English edition in 1991, was widely acclaimed. Gunter Stemberger and Markus Bockmuehl have now produced this updated edition, which is a significant revision (completed in 1996) of the 1991 volume. Following Strack&#39;s original outline, Stemberger discusses first the historical framework, the basic principles of rabbinic literature and hermeneutics and the most important Rabbis. The main part of the book is devoted to the Talmudic and Midrashic literature in the light of contemporary rabbinic research. The appendix includes a new section on electronic resources for the study of the Talmud and Midrash. The result is a comprehensive work of reference that no student of rabbinics can afford to be without.</p><p>Readers will note a number of significant changes. Most importantly, the present text substantially represents the eighth German edition published by Gunter Stemberger in 1992.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Twinkie, Deconstructed: My Journey to Discover How the Ingredients Found in Processed Foods Are Grown, M ined (Yes, Mined), and Manipulated into What America Eats</h2><p><b>A pop-science journey into the surprising ingredients found in most common packaged foods</b> <br><br>Like most Americans, Steve Ettlinger eats processed foods. And, like most consumers, he didn't have a clue as to what most of the ingredients on the labels mean. So when his young daughter asked, Daddy, what's polysorbate 60?, he was at a loss and determined to find out. <br><br>From the phosphate mines in Idaho to the oil fields in China to the Hostess factories and their practices, <i>Twinkie, Deconstructed</i> demystifies some of the most common processed food ingredients, where they come from, how they are made, how they are used, and why. Beginning at the source (hint: they're often more closely linked to rock and petroleum than any of the four food groups), we follow each Twinkie ingredient through the process of being crushed, baked, fermented, refined, and/or reacted into a totally unrecognizable goo or powder, all for the sake of creating a simple snack cake. <br><br>An insightful exploration of the modern food industry, if you've ever wondered what you're eating when you consume foods containing mono- and diglycerides or calcium sulfate (the latter a food-grade equivalent of plaster of paris), this book is for you.&nbsp; Consequently, as Hostess plans to permanently close its doors in 2012, this book will provide a relevant guide into the practices of one of the biggest companies of all time.</p><p>Since 1988 <b>Steve Ettlinger </b>has written eight books and has produced, edited, or agented over 40.&nbsp;Steve specializes in explaining very common but complicated subjects in an entertaining way. His most popular book is about artificial food ingredients (<i>Twinkie, Deconstructed</i>); he gives presentations around the country about his work on this book. His first book, <i>The Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores</i>, has remained in print for over 26 years and is now an eBook. Steve has appeared on many morning network TV shows in the course of publishing his books.For more information, or to see past TV interviews, please visit Steve's website, steveettlinger.comIts the quintessential snack treat, the subject of myth and legal proceedings. The Twinkie stands for all that is right and, perhaps, wrong with American processed food. The author examines each of the ingredients of the Twinkie, starting from the most common all the way to the unlisted less than 1 percent additives, such as color. He also examines where each ingredient comes from. Its a delicious lesson in organic chemistry, world trade, and gastronomic history. Mark Lund narrates with enthusiasm. He warms to the subject, and his tone engages listeners. He could have rendered the book as stale as a Twinkie past its sell-by date. Instead, like his topic, he is bouncy and fresh.

Instead, it is a testament to a life fully lived, a tribute to the extraordinary but fleeting human journey that delivers both boundless opportunity and crucial responsibility. In a series of intimate vignettes, Mankell ranges over rich and varied reflections: of growing up in a small Swedish town, where he experiences a startling revelation on a winter morning as a young boy; of living hand-to-mouth during a summer in Paris as an ambitious young writer; of his work at a theater in Mozambique, where&nbsp;<i>Lysistrata&nbsp;</i>is staged in the midst of civil war; of chance encounters with men and women who changed his understanding of the world. Along the way, Mankell ponders the meaning of a good life, and the critically important ways we can shape the future of humanity if we are fortunate enough to have the choice. Vivid, clear-eyed, and breathtakingly beautiful,&nbsp;<i>Quicksand</i>&nbsp;is an invaluable parting gift from a great man.</p><p>Henning Mankell&#x2019;s novels have been translated into forty-five languages and have sold more than forty million copies worldwide. He was the first winner of the Ripper Award and also received the Glass Key and the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Golden Dagger, among other awards. His Kurt Wallander mysteries have been adapted into a PBS television series starring Kenneth Branagh. During his life, Mankell divided his time between Sweden and Mozambique, where he was artistic director of the Teatro Avenida in Maputo. He died in 2015.Praise for Henning Mankell&#x2019;s <i>Quicksand</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Surely one of the most moving and intriguing farewell notes ever written. . . . Intensely beautiful in its spirit.&#x201d; &#x2014;Alexander McCall Smith,&nbsp;<i>New Statesman</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An extraordinary book. . . . Profoundly moving.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Guardian<br></i><br>&#x201c;<i>Quicksand</i>&nbsp;defines life not by its ending but by the creative and humanitarian content that filled&#x2014;and fulfilled&#x2014;Mankell&#x2019;s life. . . . The essays sharpen with resounding poignancy.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;An extremely moving swansong. . . .

But the essays of Julia Kristeva in this volume, though they often deal with literature and art, do not amount to either "literary criticism" or "art criticism." Their concern, writes Kristeva, "remains intratheoretical: they are based on art and literature in order to subvert the very theoretical, philosophical, or semiological apparatus."<br><br>Probing beyond the discoveries of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Roman Jakobson and others, Julia Kristeva proposes and tests theories centered on the nature and development of the novel, and on what she has defined as a signifying practice in poetic language and pictural works. <i>Desire in Language</i> fully shows what Roman Jakobson has called Kristeva's "genuine gift of questioning generally adopted 'axioms,' and her contrary gift of releasing various 'damned questions' from their traditional question marks."</p><p>Julia Kristeva, internationally known psychoanalyst and critic, is Professor of Linguistics at the University de Paris VII. She has hosted a French television series and is the author of many critically acclaimed books published by Columbia University Press in translation, including <i>Time and Sense: Proust and the Experience of Literature</i> and the novel, <i>Possessions.</i>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)</h2><p>In <b>Child of All Nations</b>, the reader is immediately swept up by a story that is profoundly feminist, devastatingly anticolonialist&#x2014;and full of heartbreak, suspense, love, and fury. Pramoedya immerses the reader in a world that is astonishing in its vividness: the cultural whirlpool that was the Dutch East Indies of the 1890s. A story of awakening, it follows Minke, the main character of <b>This Earth of Mankind</b>, as he struggles to overcome the injustice all around him. Pramoedya's full literary genius is evident in the brilliant characters that populate this world: Minke's fragile Mixed-Race wife; a young Chinese revolutionary; an embattled Javanese peasant and his impoverished family; the French painter Jean Marais, to name just a few.</p><p>Pramoedya Ananta Toer, born on the island of Java in 1925, was imprisoned first by the Dutch, then by the Indonesian government as a political prisoner.

E. D. : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</h2><p>Quantum electrodynamics - or QED for short - is the &#39;strange theory&#39; that explains how light and electrons interact. Thanks to Richard Feynman, it is also one of the rare parts of physics that is known for sure. In this lucid set of lectures, Feynman provides the definitive introduction to QED. &#39;It is a book to enlighten&#39; - &#34;Mail on Sunday&#34;. &#39;Marvellous...a vivid introduction to QED leavened and enlivened by his wit. Anyone with a curiosity about physics today should buy it&#39; - &#34;Nature&#34;.</p><p>Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988) was one of this century&#39;s most brilliant theoretical physicists and original thinkers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his work on QED. Books by Feynman in Penguin include The Character of Physical Law (1992, 36,000 copies), Six Easy Pieces (1998, 27,000 copies, and Six Not-So-Easy Pices (1999, 10,000 copies).This volume, constituting the printed version of the first of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lectures to be given periodically at UCLA, certainly gets this new series off to a flying start. World-renowned for the liveliness and creativity of his physical insights, Caltech physicist Feynman provides another of his tours de force as he clearly explains the arcane workings of quantum electrodynamics, a theory which Feynman himself helped to establish. Starting with such familiar phenomena as the reflection and refraction of light, Feynman goes on to describe in detail the interactions between electrons and light.

First published in 1903, it is the work of Mary Austin (1868&#x2013;1934), a prolific novelist, poet, critic, and playwright, who was also an ardent early feminist and champion of Indians and Spanish-Americans. She is best known today for this enchanting paean to the vast, arid, yet remarkably beautiful lands that lie east of the Sierra Nevadas, stretching south from Yosemite through Death Valley to the Mojave Desert.<br>Comprising&nbsp;fourteen sketches, the book describes plants, animals, mountains, birds, skies, Indians, prospectors, towns, and other aspects of the desert in serene, beautifully modulated prose that conveys the timeless cycles of life and death in a harsh land. Readers will never again think of the desert as a lifeless, barren environment but rather as a place of rare, austere beauty, rich in plant and animal life, weaving a lasting spell over its human inhabitants.<br></p><p>&#34;Between the high Sierras south from Yosemite--east and south over a very great assemblage of broken ranges beyond Death Valley, and on illimitably into the Mojave Desert&#34; is the territory that Mary Austin calls the Land of Little Rain. In this classic collection of meditations on the wonders of this region, Austin generously shares &#34;such news of the land, of its trails and what is astir in them, as one lover of it can give to another.&#34; Her vivid writings capture the landscape--from burnt hills to sun-baked mesas--as well as the rich variety of plant and animal life, and the few human beings who inhabit the land, including cattlemen, miners, and Paiute Indians. This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the original 1903 edition.A prolific author of fiction, poetry, and plays, Mary Hunter Austin (1868&#x2013;1934) was a noted defender of the rights of women, Native Americans, and Spanish-Americans. One of the American Southwest's earliest nature writers, she collaborated on a book with photographer&nbsp;Ansel Adams, <i>Taos Pueblo,</i> and was active in community theater.</p><h2>Winner Take Nothing</h2><p>Written when Hemingway was at the height of his creative powers, the stories in &#34;Winner Take Nothing&#34; glow with the mark of his unique talent. Hunters, wives, old men of wisdom, waiters, fighters, women loved, women lost: they are all here, living on the raw edge, making love, facing the inevitable reality of death. The characters, the dialogue, the settings, the remarkable insight could have come only from Hemingway&#39;s imagination. As an introduction to his work, or as an overview of the themes he developed at greater length in his novels, it is a stunningly successful collection.</p><p>Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899 as the son of a doctor and the second of six children. After a stint as an ambulance driver at the Italian front, Hemingway came home to America in 1919, only to return to the battlefield - this time as a reporter on the Greco-Turkish war - in 1922. Resigning from journalism to focus on his writing instead, he moved to Paris where he renewed his earlier friendship with fellow American expatriates such as Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Through the years, Hemingway travelled widely and wrote avidly, becoming an internationally recognized literary master of his craft. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. He died in 1961.Chapter 1: After the Storm <p>It wasn't about anything, something about making punch, and then we started fighting and I slipped and he had me down kneeling on my chest and choking me with both hands like he was trying to kill me and all the time I was trying to get the knife out of my pocket to cut him loose. Everybody was too drunk to pull him off me. He was choking me and hammering my head on the floor and I got the knife out and opened it up; and I cut the muscle right across his arm and he let go of me. He couldn't have held on if he wanted to. Then he rolled and hung onto that arm and started to cry and I said:</p> <p>"What the hell you want to choke me for?"</p> <p>I'd have killed him. I couldn't swallow for a week. He hurt my throat bad.</p> <p>Well, I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some came out after me and I made a turn and was down by the docks and I met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street. I said "Who killed him?" and he said "I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right," and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside of Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water. So I bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and I took it down along; and when it was daylight I was off Eastern Harbor.</p> <p>Brother, that was some storm. I was the first boat out and you never saw water like that was. It was just as white as a lye barrel and coming from Eastern Harbor to Sou'west Key you couldn't recognize the shore. There was a big channel blown right out through the middle of the beach. Trees and all blown out and a channel cut through and all the water white as chalk and everything on it; branches and whole trees and dead birds, and all floating. Inside the keys were all the pelicans in the world and all kinds of birds flying. They must have gone inside there when they knew it was coming.</p> <p>I lay at Sou'west Key a day and nobody came after me. I was the first boat out and I seen a spar floating and I knew there must be a wreck and I started out to look for her. I found her. She was a three-masted schooner and I could just see the stumps of her spars out of water. She was in too deep water and I didn't get anything off of her. So I went on looking for something else. I had the start on all of them and I knew I ought to get whatever there was. I went on down over the sand-bars from where I left that three-masted schooner and I didn't find anything and I went on a long way. I was way out toward the quicksands and I didn't find anything so I went on. Then when I was in sight of the Rebecca Light I saw all kinds of birds making over something and I headed over for them to see what it was and there was a cloud of birds all right.</p> <p>I could see something looked like a spar up out of the water and when I got over close the birds all went up in the air and stayed all around me. The water was clear out there and there was a spar of some kind sticking out just above the water and when I come up close to it I saw it was all dark under water like a long shadow and I came right over it and there under water was a liner; just lying there all under water as big as the whole world. I drifted over her in the boat. She lay on her side and the stern was deep down. The port holes were all shut tight and I could see the glass shine in the water and the whole of her; the biggest boat I ever saw in my life laying there and I went along the whole length of her and then I went over and anchored and I had the skiff on the deck forward and I shoved it down into the water and sculled over with the birds all around me.</p> <p>I had a water glass like we use sponging and my hand shook so I could hardly hold it. All the port holes were shut that you could see going along over her but way down below near the bottom something must have been open because there were pieces of things floating out all the time. You couldn't tell what they were. Just pieces. That's what the birds were after. You never saw so many birds. They were all around me; crazy yelling.</p> <p>I could see everything sharp and clear. I could see her rounded over and she looked a mile long under the water. She was lying on a clear white bank of sand and the spar was a sort of foremast or some sort of tackle that slanted out of water the way she was laying on her side. Her bow wasn't very far under. I could stand on the letters of her name on her bow and my head was just out of water. But the nearest port hole was twelve feet down. I could just reach it with the grains pole and I tried to break it with that but I couldn't. The glass was too stout. So I sculled back to the boat and got a wrench and lashed it to the end of the grains pole and I couldn't break it. There I was looking down through the glass at that liner with everything in her and I was the first one to her and I couldn't get into her. She must have had five million dollars worth in her.</p> <p>It made me shaky to think how much she must have in her. Inside the port hole that was closest I could see something but I couldn't make it out through the water glass. I couldn't do any good with the grains pole and I took off my clothes and stood and took a couple of deep breaths and dove over off the stern with the wrench in my hand and swam down. I could hold on for a second to the edge of the port hole and I could see in and there was a woman inside with her hair floating all out. I could see her floating plain and I hit the glass twice with the wrench hard and I heard the noise clink in my ears but it wouldn't break and I had to come up.</p> <p>I hung onto the dinghy and got my breath and then I climbed in and took a couple of breaths and dove again. I swam down and took hold of the edge of the port hole with my fingers and held it and hit the glass as hard as I could with the wrench. I could see the woman floated in the water through the glass. Her hair was tied once close to her head and it floated all out in the water. I could see the rings on one of her hands. She was right up close to the port hole and I hit the glass twice and I didn't even crack it. When I came up I thought I wouldn't make it to the top before I'd have to breathe.</p> <p>I went down once more and I cracked the glass, only cracked it, and when I came up my nose was bleeding and I stood on the bow of the liner with my bare feet on the letters of her name and my head just out and rested there and then I swam over to the skiff and pulled up into it and sat there waiting for my head to stop aching and looking down into the water glass, but I bled so I had to wash out the water glass. Then I lay back in the skiff and held my hand under my nose to stop it and I lay there with my head back looking up and there was a million birds above and all around.</p> <p>When I quit bleeding I took another look through the glass and then I sculled over to the boat to try and find something heavier than the wrench but I couldn't find a thing; not even a sponge hook. I went back and the water was clearer all the time and you could see everything that floated out over that white bank of sand. I looked for sharks but there weren't any. You could have seen a shark a long way away. The water was so cleak and the sand white. There was a grapple for an anchor on the skiff and I cut it off and went overboard and down with it. It carried me right down and past the port hole and I grabbed and couldn't hold anything and went on down and down, sliding along the curved side of her. I had to let go of the grapple. I heard it bump once and it seemed like a year before I came up through to the top of the water. The skiff was floated away with the tide and I swam over to her with my nose bleeding in the water while I swam and I was plenty glad there weren't sharks; but I was tired.</p> <p>My head felt cracked open and I lay in the skiff and rested and then I sculled back. It was getting along in the afternoon. I went down once more with the wrench and it didn't do any good. That wrench was too light. It wasn't any good diving unless you had a big hammer or something heavy enough to do good. Then I lashed the wrench to the grains pole again and I watched through the water glass and pounded on the glass and hammered until the wrench came off and I saw it in the glass, clear and sharp, go sliding down along her and then off and down to the quicksand and go in. Then I couldn't do a thing. The wrench was gone and I'd lost the grapple so I sculled back to the boat. I was too tired to get the skiff aboard and the sun was pretty low. The birds were all pulling out and leaving her and I headed for Sou'west Key towing the skiff and the birds going on ahead of me and behind me. I was plenty tired.</p> <p>That night it came on to blow and it blcw for a week. You couldn't get out to her. They come out from town and told me the fellow I'd had to cut was all right except for his arm and I went back to town and they put me under five hundred dollar bond. It came out all right because some of them, friends of mine, swore he was after me with an ax, but by the time we got back out to her the Greeks had blown her open and cleaned her out. They got the safe out with dynamite. Nobody ever knows how much they got. She carried gold and they got it all. They stripped her clean. I found her and I never got a nickel out of her.</p> <p>It was a hell of a thing all right. They say she was just outside of Havana harbor when the hurricane hit and she couldn't get in or the owners wouldn't let the captain chance coming in; they say he wanted to try; so she had to go with it and in the dark they were running with it trying to go through the gulf between Rebecca and Tortugas when she struck on the quicksands. Maybe her rudder was carried away. Maybe they weren't even steering. But anyway they couldn't have known they were quicksands and when she struck the captain must have ordered them to open up the ballast tanks so she'd lay solid. But it was quicksand she'd...</p></p><h2>Designs for Living and Learning, Second Edition: Transforming Early Childhood Environments</h2><p><p>You likely have dreams for your early childhood environment that are greater than rating scales, regulations, and room arrangements. <i>Designs for Living and Learning</i> has been a favorite resource among educators and caregivers for more than a decade, and this new edition is packed with even more ideas that can be used as you create captivating environments that nurture children, families, and staff while supporting children's learning.

Introduced by Nobel Prize winner Jos� Saramago, and illustrated with beautiful black and white photographs, Our Word Is Our Weapon crystallizes "the passion of a rebel, the poetry of a movement, and the literary genius of indigenous Mexico." <br>Marcos first captured world attention on January 1, 1994, when he and an indigenous guerrilla group calling themselves "Zapatistas" revolted against the Mexican government and seized key towns in Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas. In the six years that have passed since their uprising, Marcos has altered the course of Mexican politics and emerged an international symbol of grassroots movement-building, rebellion, and democracy. The prolific stream of poetic political writings, tales, and traditional myths that Marcos has penned since January 1, 1994 fill more than four volumes. Our Word Is Our Weapon presents the best of these writings, many of which have never been published before in English.<br>Throughout this remarkable book we hear the uncompromising voice of indigenous communities living in resistance, expressing through manifestos and myths the universal human urge for dignity, democracy, and liberation. It is the voice of a people refusing to be forgotten the voice of Mexico in transition, the voice of a people struggling for democracy by using their word as their only weapon.</p><p>SUBCOMANDANTE MARCOS is a spokesperson and strategist for the Zapatistas, an indigenous insurgency movement based in Mexico. He first joined the indigenous guerrilla group that would become the Zapatistas in the early 1980s. Marcos is author of several books translated into English, including Shadows of Tender Fury (Monthly Review Press) which featured early letters and communiques, and a children&#39;s book Story of the Colors (Cinco Puntos), which won a Firecracker Alternative Book Award.In 1994, as a guerrilla group of indigenous people calling themselves "Zapatistas" rose up in armed rebellion in the poor Mexican state of Chiapas, the writings of their enigmatic spokesman, Marcos, began being published in various Mexican journals and newspapers. They have since been disseminated around the world via the Internet and by Cinco Puntos press in the U.S. This collection of Marcos's work clearly shows--no matter one's stance on his politics--why he has become an international phenomenon: he is a writer of rare ability. As a political analyst and propagandist, Marcos offers trenchant analyses of the plight of the native people of Mexico, their neglect by a corrupt national government and the exacerbation of their poverty and marginality, according to him, as "neoliberalism"--i.e., international finance--permeated that nation. But he moves easily to romantic realist musings on his life in the remote mountains of Chiapas and the path that led him to the role of rebel. Finally he becomes a fabulist, writing his own brief tales--at times achingly poetic, at other times laugh-out-loud funny--and retelling the ancient myths and legends from Mexico's Mayan past. Though the pieces here are, in the end, difficult to categorize, what connects them is Marcos's commitment to making the indigenous people visible, revealing the poverty of their lives and the richness of their traditions. He writes, "Being silent, our voice was passing away." Marcos has broken that silence in language as strong as dignity and as subtle as love. To read this collection is to discover that rare animal: an original voice. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Road Past Mandalay</h2><p>This is the second part of John Masters&#39; autobiography: how he fought with his Gurkha regiment during World War II until his promotion to command one of the Chindit columns behind enemy lines in Burma. Written by a bestselling novelist at the height of his powers, it is an exceptionally moving story that culminates in him having to personally shoot a number of wounded British soldiers who cannot be evacuated before their position is overrun by the Japanese. It is an uncomfortable reminder that Churchill&#39;s obsession with &#39;special forces&#39; squandered thousands of Allied lives in operations that owed more to public relations than strategic calculation. This military and moral odyssey is one of the greatest of World War II frontline memoirs.</p><p>John Masters was commissioned into the Gurkha Rifles on the eve of the Second World War and rose to command one of the Chindit columns fighting behind the lines against the Japanese in Burma.

Ms. Russo lives in Westchester County, New York.Starred Review. Grade 2-4&#x2013;The experiences of Russo's relatives before, during, and after World War II are the basis for this story about a grandmother sharing with her young granddaughter photo albums of her "first life" (in Germany) and her "second life" (after the war). Rachel's family gathers for Sunday dinner at Oma's. After the meal, Oma tells the girl of her marriage and her family's happy life; her husband's death after World War I; the rise of the Nazi party and denial of rights to Jews; the burning and looting of Jewish businesses; and life in a concentration camp. At war's end, Oma and her three daughters were reunited in America. Now she gives Rachel the gold heart necklace that her own grandmother gave her many years ago when her family left Poland for Germany ("When you wear this...always remember me and...May luck follow you wherever you go"). This book introduces the Holocaust in a simple but factual narrative that can be easily understood by youngsters who have no knowledge of World War II. Gouache illustrations in Russo's familiar folk style are accompanied by many re-creations of old photos, government papers, money, an identity card&#x2013;all helping to bring the events to life. Photos on the endpapers show the author's family. This offering answers the need for appropriate Holocaust literature for young children and should be considered a first purchase.<i>&#x2013;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here, she organizes her thinking around broader themes such as "contemplative," "reflective" and "heart" listening, three modes that she says can help us to listen deeply to the divine, ourselves and one another. Lindahl hopes that people can slowly strengthen their listening "muscles" and pull themselves back from the brink of non-communication. She explores the implications of listening to friends, family, co-workers and ourselves. Calling thoughtful attention to the myriad ways we share conversation, she delineates among the formats and intentions of debates, arguments, councils, consultations, discussions, dialogues, negotiations, mediation and chitchat. The spiritual value of being present while listening shines within her clear, guileless strategies. Each chapter offers concrete techniques to practice listening, and the "Daily Practices" section is filled with ways to restore loving kindness to language. She also has clear directions for "Interfaith Cafe" etiquette, where lively conversation can spark lasting change among people of different faiths, viewpoints or life experiences. Similar to her first book, this is by turns both obvious and profound; on the whole, however, it has deep merit for all who want to reclaim the essential art of spiritual listening. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mark Hearld&#39;s Workbook</h2><p>The artist Mark Hearld finds his inspiration in the flora and fauna of the British countryside: a blue-eyed jay perched on an oak branch; two hares enjoying the spoils of an allotment; a mute swan standing at the frozen water&#x2019;s edge; and a sleek red fox prowling the fields. Hearld admires such twentieth-century artists as Edward Bawden, John Piper, Eric Ravilious and Enid Marx, and, like them, he chooses to work in a range of media paint, print, collage, textiles and ceramics. Workbook is the first collection of Hearld&#x2019;s beguiling art. The works are grouped into nature-related themes introduced by Hearld, who narrates the story behind some of his creations and discusses his influences. He explains his particular love of collage, which he favours for its graphic quality and potential for strong composition. Art historian Simon Martin contributes an essay on Hearld&#x2019;s place in the English popular-art tradition, and also meets Hearld in his museum-like home to explore the artist&#x2019;s passion for collecting objects, his working methods and his startling ability to view the wonders of the natural world as if through a child&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>MARK HEARLD studied at Glasgow School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London.

He is edged off the investigation of a brutal robbery by more experienced officers, but soon he is on another case that is not only unsolved but has not even been recognized as murder. Forgotten in a dilapidated barn stands a bullet-riddled old car, and it looks as if the driver did not get out alive. This case will shape Wisting as a policeman and give him insight that he will carry with him for the rest of his professional career: generations form an unbroken chain.</p><p>Jorn Lier Horst is the author of the highly successful William Wisting series of crime novels. When It Grows Dark is the sixth to be translated into English after Dregs, Closed for Winter, The Hunting Dogs, The Caveman, and Ordeal. Previous books in the series have won the Riverton Prize, the Glass Key, the Martin Beck Award, and the Petrona Award.This tense entry to William Wisting's story turns out to be a satisfying mystery expertly unraveled. --Mark Douglas-Home, author of The Sea Detective<br><br>As he's about to address a group of police officer trainees, Chief Inspector William Wisting receives a letter that dramatically changes his remarks, which now invite the student officers to join him in clearing up a cold case nearly a century old. An extended flashback returns Wisting to the Christmas season of 1983, when he and his wife, Ingrid, have just become the parents of twins Thomas and Line, and when Rupert Hansson, a friend of Ingrid's father's looking for an old car to restore, excitedly informs him of an ancient Minerva he's heard rumors about inside a barn at Tveidalskrysset that appears to be locked from both inside and out. Following up on Hansson's discovery after he's bumped off a robbery investigation, Wisting finds that the car is indeed a Minerva Saloon manufactured in the 1920s, that it's very much in need of restoration, and that the extensive damage includes two holes made by bullets that would seem to have struck its absent driver. Intent on following the car's paper trail, Wisting unearths a document that lists it as "Lost, 21.08.1925." The Minerva evidently went missing along with Marvin Bergan, whose brother Martinius worked for the company that imported it, when it was pressed into service to transport a large quantity of bank notes during a railroad strike. Now that he's established a plausible motive for the car's disappearance, Wisting needs only to identify the person or persons who stole the money and executed the courier a remarkably tall order for a case that's already nearly 60 years old by the time he gets it and one whose leading suspects have mostly long since died. Not nearly as raw or powerful as Horst's earlier cases (Ordeal, 2017, etc.) but still a deft and effective "prequel as well as a milestone" in the life of its suddenly retrospective hero. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>*Starred Review* Horst s excellent sixth William Wisting mystery to appear in English (after Ordeal) returns to the chief inspector s early career in between his present-day reflections on his 30-plus years of service in Larvik, a small town in Norway s southwest Vestfold county. As Wisting prepares to welcome trainee police officers, he receives a letter that plunges him and his students back into a nearly century-old cold case. Flash back to 1983. Wisting, a recently qualified uniformed police officer, is a new father to twins Line and Thomas and a devoted husband to Ingrid, the exemplary wife he will lose to illness years later. Horst minutely chronicles young Wisting s private investigation into a major unsolved 1925 theft, undertaken after more experienced cops push him off a violent robbery case. Wisting learns to trust his ability to combine logic and intuition as he idealistically sets out to make a better world. This prequel is a fine starting place for newcomers. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings</h2><p>This essential volume brings together more than forty of the most important historical writings on feminism, covering 150 years of the struggle for women&#x2019;s freedom.

Now, more than ten years after the original publication of that book, the time has come to celebrate the many third places that dot the American landscape and foster civic life. With 20 black-and-white photographs, Celebrating the Third Place brings together fifteen firsthand accounts by proprietors of third places, as well as appreciations by fans who have made spending time at these hangouts a regular part of their lives. Among the establishments profiled are a shopping center in Seattle, a three-hundred-year-old tavern in Washington, D.C., a garden shop in Amherst, Massachusetts, a coffeehouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, a bookstore in Traverse City, Michigan, and a restaurant in San Francisco.</p><p>RAY OLDENBURG, PH.D., Professor Emeritus of sociology at the University of West Florida, coined the term "third place" and is widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s leading advocates for and authorities on great good places. His book, <i>The Great Good Place,</i> a <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Editor&#x2019;s Choice for 1989, was reissued in 1999. He is frequently sought after as a media commentator and consultant to entrepreneurs, community and urban planners, and others. He lives in Pensacola, Florida.Sociologist Oldenburg (The Great, Good Place) offers a compilation of essays on those places in America "where everybody knows your name." What Oldenburg calls "the third place" is different from home and work (the first and second places respectively) it's somewhere people can relax in good company on a regular basis. In this collection of 19 essays, proprietors and patrons of those third places describe how their establishments came into being and what exactly gives them their appeal. These third places aren't just diners and coffeehouses: there are establishments as disparate as Annie's Gift and Garden Shop, in Amherst, Mass., whose witty and provocative billboards provide a jumping-off point for conversation within the community, and Old St. George, an espresso bar located within a church's sacristy in Cleveland, Ohio. There's also the "great good gym" and, perhaps most surprising, an essay claiming prison to be the third place for many disadvantaged in American society. These charming and often thought-provoking essays, each written in a voice distinct as the place discussed, provide food for thought into the isolation our modern conveniences bring and people's need to come together as a community. This book will strike a comforting chord for those questioning the status quo and desiring to live a more authentic and connected way of life. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Elective Affinities (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><p>Condemned as immoral when it was first published, this novel reflects the conflict Goethe felt between his respect for the conventions of marriage and the possibility of spontaneous passion.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Sonatas are generally thought of as being always organized into exposition, development, and recapitulation, but, writes Rosen, &#34;...it is very dubious that a unique sonata form can be so defined even for a single decade of the late eighteenth-century,&#34; and he goes on to prove why it can&#39;t.

One of the most famous Sioux writers and activists of the modern era, Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Bonnin) recalled legends and tales from oral tradition and used experiences from her life and community to educate others about the Yankton Sioux. Determined, controversial, and visionary, she creatively worked to bridge the gap between her own culture and mainstream American society and advocated for Native rights on a national level. Susan Rose Dominguez provides a new introduction to this edition.</p><p>Zitkala-Sa (1876&#x2013;1938) is also the author of <i>Old Indian Legends</i> and <i>Dreams and Thunder: Stories, Poems, and &#x201c;The Sun Dance Opera,&#x201d;</i> both published by the University of Nebraska Press. Susan Rose Dominguez is an affiliate scholar of history at Oberlin College.Zitkala-sa, renamed Gertrude Simmons by Catholic missionaries, was one of the first Sioux women to write the stories and traditions of her people. The first set of stories in this collection is autobiographical. Zitkala-sa describes living in her mother's wigwam on the Yankton Reservation at the edge of the Missouri River where she is "as free as the wind that blew my hair, and no less spirited than a bounding deer." Until she is eight years old, Zitkala-sa's only fear is "that of intruding myself upon others." Then, despite her mother's objections, she is enticed by visions of endless apple trees and the excitement of riding on "the iron horse" and leaves her mother for school in the east. Although Zitkala-sa goes on to become a teacher, she never stops questioning "whether real life or long-lasting death lies beneath this semblance of [white] civilization." The second half of the book contains stories based on her family's tradition of oral history. <i>The Trial Path</i> describes the course of tribal justice after a murder. Tusee, <i>A Warrior's Daughter</i>, is the courageous and shrewd woman who risks everything for her husband-to-be. The son in <i>The Sioux</i> must kill twice to save his father from starvation. Written with elegant simplicity more than seventy years ago, Zitkala-sa's <b>American Indian Stories</b> remain a powerful plea for justice. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>I Was Anastasia: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Compelling and utterly fascinating...drifts far into the mysterious lives of Anastasia Romanov and Anna Anderson.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lisa Wingate, author of <i>Before We Were Yours</i></b><br><br><b><b>In an enthralling new feat of historical suspense, Ariel Lawhon</b>&nbsp;unravels the extraordinary twists and turns in Anna Anderson's 50-year battle to be recognized as Anastasia Romanov.

With a brilliantly crafted dual narrative structure, Lawhon wades into the most psychologically complex and emotionally compelling territory yet: the nature of identity itself.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The question of who Anna Anderson is and what actually happened to Anastasia Romanov creates a saga that spans fifty years and touches three continents.

Three startling metallic alarms and then Jack snatches it from the cradle. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Manahan residence.&#x201d; A pause, and then, &#x201c;yes, she&#x2019;s here. Hold on a moment.&#x201d; The cord won&#x2019;t stretch across the room so Jack lays it on the sideboard. He grins wildly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Germany.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;The Prince.&#x201d; He beams, then clarifies&#x2014;there have been a number of princes in her life. &#x201c;Frederick.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anna feels a wild stab of anger at the name. She hasn&#x2019;t forgotten what Frederick did, hasn&#x2019;t forgotten the burn pile behind her cottage at the edge of the Black Forest. All those charred little bones. If the news had come from anyone else she would take the call. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to speak with him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;He knows why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I really think it&#x2019;s time you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anna holds her hand up, palm out, a firm, final sort of motion. &#x201c;Take a message.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Jack pouts but doesn&#x2019;t protest. He knows that arguing is futile. Anna does not change her mind. Nor does she forgive. He picks up the receiver again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. She doesn&#x2019;t want to speak right now. Why don&#x2019;t you give me the news?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And then she watches Jack&#x2019;s countenance fall by tiny, heartbreaking increments. First his smile. Then his lifted, expectant brows. His right arm drops to his side, deflated. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; he says, finally, then clears his throat as though he&#x2019;s swallowed a cobweb.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Write it down,&#x201d; Anna instructs. &#x201c;Word for word.&#x201d; She doesn&#x2019;t want to interpret the verdict through his anger once he hangs up. Anna wants to know exactly what the appeals court has to say. Jack is too emotional and prone to exaggeration. He needs to transcribe it or vital bits of information will be lost the moment he hangs up. Gleb wouldn&#x2019;t need this instruction. He would know what to do. He would know what questions to ask. But Gleb is no longer here and, once again this reality leaves her feeling adrift.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Let me write this down,&#x201d; Jack says, like it&#x2019;s his idea. She watches him shuffle through piles of paper on the cluttered sideboard, looking for a notebook with blank pages. Finding none, he grabs an envelope and turns it over. &#x201c;Go ahead. I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>A decade ago Anna&#x2019;s lawyer told her this lawsuit was the longest running case in German history. This appeal has stretched it into something worse, something interminable. And there stands Jack, writing the footnote to her quest on the back of their electric bill in his tidy, ever-legible script. &#x201c;How do you spell that?&#x201d; he asks at one point, holding the phone with one hand and recording the verdict with the other. He doesn&#x2019;t rush or scribble but rather pens each word with painstaking precision, occasionally asking Frederick to repeat himself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Jack and Anna don&#x2019;t have many friends. They haven&#x2019;t been married long, only two years, and theirs is a relationship based on convenience and necessity, not romance. They are old and eccentric and not fit for polite society in this quaint college town. But a handful of people&#x2014;mostly former professors at the University of Virginia, like Jack&#x2014;are due to arrive shortly. Anna doesn&#x2019;t want to know how he convinced them to come. It would have been awkward before. It will be excruciating now. Anna decides there won&#x2019;t be a party tonight. She doesn&#x2019;t have the heart to entertain strangers this evening.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But Jack, in all his eagerness, has catered for a celebration. Their small den is littered with trays of fruit and sandwiches. Deviled eggs and cheese platters. Tiny brined pickles and cocktail sausages skewered with toothpicks. He even bought three bottles of champagne and they sit in a bowl of ice, unopened beneath the string of Christmas lights he&#x2019;s stapled to the ceiling. Anna stares at the bottles with suspicion. She hasn&#x2019;t touched the stuff in almost four decades. The last time Anna drank champagne she ended up naked on a rooftop in New York City. <br> The entire setting is tacky and festive&#x2014;just like her husband. Jack bought a rhinestone tiara from the costume shop near the college campus just for the occasion. It sits on a gaudy red velvet pillow next to the champagne. He&#x2019;s been dying to crown her since they met and only today, only in the hopes of a positive verdict, has she humored him. But that hope is gone now. Snuffed out in a German courtroom on the other side of the world.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he finally says, and then lower, almost a whisper, &#x201c;I will. I&#x2019;m sorry. You know how it can be with her. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll speak with you next time. Goodbye.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When he turns back to Anna, Jack has the envelope pressed to his chest. He doesn&#x2019;t speak.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;We need to call our guests and tell them the party&#x2019;s cancelled.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He looks crushed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t your fault. You did what you could.&#x201d; A deep breath. A shrug. &#x201c;What did Frederick say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your appeal was rejected. They won&#x2019;t reverse the lower court&#x2019;s ruling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I gathered that. Tell me<i> </i>his words <i>exactly</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Jack looks to the paper. &#x201c;They regard your claim as a &#x2018;<i>non liquet</i>.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Interesting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Not clear&#x2019; or &#x2018;not proven.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When Jack frowns, he puckers his mouth until his upper lip nearly touches his nose. It&#x2019;s an odd, childish expression and one he&#x2019;s used with greater frequency the longer he has known her. &#x201c;Is that German?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Latin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;You know <i>Latin</i>?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Very little at this point.&#x201d; Anna swats at him. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;The judges said that even though your death has never been proven, neither has your escape.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Ah. Clever.&#x201d; She smiles at this dilemma. It is the ultimate Catch 22. Her escape <i>can&#x2019;t</i> be proven without a formal declaration of identity from the court. &#x201c;Read the rest please.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He holds the envelope six inches from his nose and slowly recites the verdict. &#x201c;&#x2018;We have <i>not </i>decided that the plaintiff is <i>not</i> Grand Duchess Anastasia, but only that the Hamburg court made it&#x2019;s decision without legal mistakes and without procedural errors.&#x2019;&#x201d; He looks up. &#x201c;So they have decided...<i>nothing</i>?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>She shakes her head slowly and then with more determination. &#x201c;Oh they have decided everything, Jack.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;It was that photo, wasn&#x2019;t it? The court must have seen it. There&#x2019;s no other reason they would rule against you. Damn that Rasputin. <i>Damn</i> her!&#x201d; Jack begins to pace again. &#x201c;We could make a statement&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; Anna lifts her chin with all the dignity she can muster and folds her hands in her lap. She is resigned and regal. &#x201c;They will never formally recognize me as Anastasia Romanov.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><br>Two Years Earlier</b><br> <i>Charlottesville, Virginia, December 23, 1968</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Anna does not want to marry Jack Manahan. She would rather marry Gleb. Even after all the trouble he&#x2019;s caused through the years. But theirs is a story of false starts and near misses. Bad timing. Distance. And rash decisions. They were not meant to be. So Gleb has urged her to marry Jack instead. This whole fiasco is his idea&#x2014;the courthouse, the silly pink dress, the bouquet of roses and pinecones, the white, rabbit fur hat that she&#x2019;s supposed to wear out of the courthouse to greet the photographers (these arranged by Jack because the damnable man cannot help but make a scene everywhere he goes). Gleb insists the hat makes her look the part of Russian Grand Duchess. She refuses to wear the thing. Poor rabbit. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When they discussed this ridiculous plan in August, Gleb said his health was to blame, that he couldn&#x2019;t marry her himself. He said that she would end up caring for him instead, but Anna believes that this is punishment for a long-held resentment. Tit for tat. Wound for wound. He has loved her for decades and she has never been able to fully reciprocate. Now he stands as witness to her unwilling nuptials. As best man, in fact.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It is snowing outside the courthouse. Not the angry, hard, blistering shards of snow she&#x2019;s used to in Germany, but fat, lethargic flakes that drift and flutter and take their time getting to the ground. Lazy snow. American snow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anna&#x2019;s had only a single a tryst since that limpid summer in Bavaria all those years ago, but Gleb moved on. Got married. Had children. They&#x2019;ve never talked about the intervening years and it&#x2019;s not worth bringing up now. Anna is seventy-two&#x2014;too old to get married at all, much less for the first time. Jack Manahan is twenty years her junior. A former professor enamored with Russian history, with her&#x2014;or, at least, the <i>idea</i> of her. Regardless, he hasn&#x2019;t put up much of a fight since being presented with the plan. Jack&#x2019;s only show of hesitation was a long, curious look at Gleb. Assessing his attachment and willingness to let Anna go. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It occurred to her, far too late into this arrangement, that she had not considered the issue of sex. Jack is young. <i>Younger</i> at least. And she is...well...she is <i>not</i>. The idea of consummation almost caused her to back out entirely. All of those hormones have shriveled up, turned to dust, and blown away. Desire is little more than a fond memory these days. <br> Gleb has taken care of that issue as well, however, assuring her that sex isn&#x2019;t a necessary part of this bargain. She and Jack will have separate bedrooms. This will be a legal marriage, enough to keep her in the United States once her visa expires in three weeks, but it will be a marriage of convenience only. Gleb swore this, endless times, over what ended up being their last shared bottle of wine. Jack will not set a hand on her. Unless she wants him to. Why Gleb added that last part she isn&#x2019;t sure. He wouldn&#x2019;t meet her eyes as he said it and she said nothing in return. It was a small cruelty. This is how it is with them, apparently. Little wounds. Paper cuts. Just enough to sting but not really harm. Perhaps it&#x2019;s best that they aren&#x2019;t marrying one another after all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Gleb slips into the antechamber beside the courtroom and surveys her tiny, slender form. &#x201c;You look nice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nb...</p><h2>Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition (Clarendon Paperbacks)</h2><p>This is the first book to analyze systematically crucial aspects of ancient Greek philosophy in their original context of mystery, religion, and magic.

He is still honored in Spain as a national hero for liberating the fatherland from the occupying Moors. Yet, as Richard Fletcher shows in this award-winning book, there are many contradictions between eleventh-century reality and the mythology that developed with the passing years.<br> By placing El Cid in a fresh, historical context, Fletcher shows us an adventurous soldier of fortune who was of a type, one of a number of "cids," or "bosses," who flourished in eleventh-century Spain. But the El Cid of legend--the national hero--was unique in stature even in his lifetime. Before his death El Cid was already celebrated in a poem written in tribute of the conquest of Almer�a; posthumously he was immortalized in the great epic <em>Poema de Mio Cid</em> and became the centerpiece for countless other works of literature. When he died in Valencia in 1099, he was ruler of an independent principality he had carved for himself in Eastern Spain. Rather than the zealous Christian leader many believe him to have been, Rodrigo emerges in Fletcher's study as a mercenary equally at home in the feudal kingdoms of northern Spain and the exotic Moorish lands of the south, selling his martial skills to Christian and Muslim alike. Indeed, his very title derives from the Arabic word <em>sayyid</em> meaning "lord" or "master." And as there was little if any sense of Spanish nationhood in the eleventh century, he can hardly be credited for uniting a medieval Spanish nation.<br> In this ground-breaking inquiry into the life and times of El Cid, Fletcher disentangles fact from myth to create a striking portrait of an extraordinary man, clearly showing how and why legend transformed him into something he was not during his life. A fascinating journey through a turbulent epoch, <em>The Quest for El Cid</em> is filled with the excitement of discovery, and will delight readers interested not only in Spanish history and literature, but those who want to understand how myth can shape our perception of history.<br></p><p><br> <strong>Richard Fletcher</strong> is Senior Lecturer in History at the University of York and is the author of numerous books on medieval Spain, including the forthcoming <em>Moorish Spain</em>.<br>Beginning students, sophisticated scholars, and the general reader interested in Spanish medieval history will benefit from this provocative, learned, and elegantly written study of Rodrigo Diaz (c.1043-99)--El Cid--the 11th-century soldier of fortune who became the Spanish national hero. Fletcher begins by sketching the historical scene in Spain and Europe. After an imaginative discussion of the complicated sources of El Cid's life, he describes his aristocratic family background, knightly education, early military campaigns, service at the court of king Sancho II, exile spent as a mercenary soldier in Muslim service, and ultimate triumph as Prince of Valencia. The concluding chapter, as exciting as a murder mystery, explains the growth of the El Cid legend. As an important story fascinatingly told, and as a rich mine of information about many facets of Spanish and Muslim medieval cultures, this book is highly recommended.<br><i>- Bennett D.

Into it he poured all his love of detail, his delight in the life of the mind, his despair of human nature, and his pleasure in passionate friendship. The result is &#x201c;a kind of encyclopedia made into farce,&#x201d; wholly grotesque and wholly original, in the spirit of <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i> or <i>Ulysses</i>.</p><p><b>Gustave Flaubert</b> was born in Rouen in 1821, the son of a prominent physician. A solitary child, he was attracted to literature at an early age, and after his recovery from a nervous breakdown suffered while a law student, he turned his total energies to writing. Aside from journeys to the Near East, Greece, Italy, and North Africa, and a stormy liaison with the poetess Louise Colet, his life was dedicated to the practice of his art. The form of his work was marked by intense aesthetic scrupulousness and passionate pursuit of le mot juste; its content alternately reflected scorn for French bourgeois society and a romantic taste for exotic historical subject matter. The success of <b>Madame Bovary</b> (1857) was ensured by government prosecution for &#x201c;immorality&#x201d;; <b>Salammb�</b> (1862) and <b>The Sentimental Education</b> (1869) received a cool public reception; not until the publication of <b>Three Tales</b> (1877) was his genius popularly acknowledged. Among fellow writers, however, his reputation was supreme. His circle of friends included Turgenev and the Goncourt brothers, while the young Guy de Maupassant underwent an arduous literary apprenticeship under his direction. Increasing personal isolation and financial insecurity troubled his last years. His final bitterness and disillusion were vividly evidenced in the savagely satiric <b>Bouvard and P�cuchet</b>, left unfinished at his death in 1880.<br><br><b>Dr. A.J.

In these stories the Op unravels a murder with too many clues, looks for a girl with eyes the color of shadows on polished silver, and tangles with a crooked-eared gunman called the Whosis Kid.</p><p>Dashiell Samuel Hammett was born in St. Mary&#x2019;s County. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereafter&#x2014;messenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkerton&#x2019;s Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In <b>The Maltese Falcon</b> (1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade. <b>The Thin Man</b> (1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles. <b>Red Harvest</b> (1929), <b>The Dain Curse</b> (1929), and <b>The Glass Key</b> (1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammett&#x2019;s later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story &#x201c;Tulip,&#x201d; which is contained in the posthumous collection <b>The Big Knockover</b> (1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories, <b>The Continental Op</b> (1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the &#x201c;Op,&#x201d; a nameless detective (or &#x201c;operative&#x201d;) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled mold&#x2014;a bit like Hammett himself.THE TENTH CLEW &#34;Mr. Leopold Gantvoort is not at home,&#34; the servant who opened the door said, &#34;but his son, Mr. Charles, is--if you wish to see him.&#34; &#34;No, I had an appointment with Mr. Leopold Gantvoort for nine or a little after. It&#39;s just nine now. No doubt he&#39;ll be back soon. I&#39;ll wait.&#34; &#34;Very well, sir.&#34; He stepped aside for me to enter the house, took my overcoat and hat, guided me to a room on the second floor--Gantvoort&#39;s library--and left me. I picked up a magazine from the stack on the table, pulled an ash tray over beside me, and made myself comfortable. An hour passed. I stopped reading and began to grow impatient. Another hour passed--and I was fidgeting. A clock somewhere below had begun to strike eleven when a young man of twenty-five or -six, tall and slender, with remarkably white skin and very dark hair and eyes, came into the room. &#34;My father hasn&#39;t returned yet,&#34; he said. &#34;it&#39;s too bad that you should have been kept waiting all this time. Isn&#39;t there anything I could do for you? I am Charles Gantvoort.&#34; &#34;No, thank you.&#34; I got up from my chair, accepting the courteous dismissal. &#34;I&#39;ll get in touch with him tomorrow.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he murmured, and we moved toward the door together. As we reached the hall an extension telephone in one corner of the room we were leaving buzzed softly, and I halted in the doorway while Charles Gantvoort went over to answer it. His back was toward me as he spoke into the instrument. &#34;Yes. Yes, Yes!&#34;--sharply--&#34;What? Yes&#34;--very weakly--&#34;Yes.&#34; He turned slowly around and faced me with a face that was gray and tortured, with wide shocked eyes and gaping mouth--the telephone still in his hand. &#34;Father,&#34; he gasped, &#34;is dead--killed!&#34; &#34;Where? How?&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t know. That was the police. They want me to come down at once.&#34; He straightened his shoulders with an effort, pulling himself together, put down the telephone, and his face fell into less strained lines. &#34;You will pardon my--&#34; &#34;Mr. Gantvoort,&#34; I interrupted his apology. &#34;I am connected with the Continental Detective Agency. Your father called up this afternoon and asked that a detective be sent to see him tonight. He said his life had been threatened. He hadn&#39;t definitely engaged us, however, so unless you--&#34; &#34;Certainly! You are employed! If the police haven&#39;t already caught the murderer I want you to do everything possible to catch him.&#34; &#34;All right! Let&#39;s get down to headquarters.&#34; Neither of us spoke during the ride to the Hall of Justice. Gantvoort bent over the wheel of his car, sending it through the streets at a terrific speed. There were several questions that needed answers, but all his attention was required for his driving if he was to maintain the pace at which he was driving without piling us into something. So I didn&#39;t disturb him, but hung on and kept quiet. Half a dozen police detectives were waiting for us when we reached the detective bureau. O&#39;Gar--a bullet-headed detective sergeant who dresses like the village constable in a movie, wide-brimmed black hat and all, but who isn&#39;t to be put out of the reckoning on that account--was in charge of the investigation. He and I had worked on two or three jobs together before, and hit it off excellently. He led us into one of the small offices below the assembly room. Spread out on the flat top of a desk there were a dozen or more objects. &#34;I want you to look these things over carefully,&#34; the detective-sergeant told Gantvoort, &#34;and pick out the ones that belonged to your father.&#34; &#34;But where is he?&#34; &#34;Do this first,&#34; O&#39;Gar insisted, &#34;and then you can see him.&#34; I looked at the things on the table while Charles Gantvoort made his selections. An empty jewel case; a memorandum book; three letters in slit envelopes that were addressed to the dead man; some other papers; a bunch of keys; a fountain pen; two white linen handkerchiefs; two pistol cartridges; a gold watch, with a gold knife and a gold pencil attached to it by a gold-and-platinum chain; two black leather wallets, one of them very new and the other worn; some money, both paper and silver; and a small portable typewriter, bent and twisted, and matted with hair and blood. Some of the other things were smeared with blood and some were clean. Gantvoort picked out the watch and its attachments, the keys, the fountain pen, the memoranda book, the handkerchiefs, the letters and other papers, and the older wallet. &#34;There were Father&#39;s,&#34; he told us. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen any of the others before. I don&#39;t know, of course, how much money he had with him tonight, so I can&#39;t say how much of this is his.&#34; &#34;You&#39;re sure none of the rest of this stuff was his?&#34; O&#39;Gar asked. &#34;I don&#39;t think so, but I&#39;m not sure. Whipple could tell you.&#34; He turned to me. &#34;He&#39;s the man who let you in tonight. He looked after Father, and he&#39;d know positively whether any of these other things belonged to him or not.&#34; One of the police detectives went to the telephone to tell Whipple to come down immediately. I resumed the questioning. &#34;Is anything that your father usually carried with him missing? Anything of value?&#34; &#34;Not that I know of. All the things that he might have been expected to have with him seem to be here.&#34; &#34;At what time tonight did he leave the house?&#34; &#34;Before seven-thirty. Possibly as early as seven.&#34; &#34;Know where he was going?&#34; &#34;He didn&#39;t tell me, but I supposed he was going to call on Miss Dexter.&#34; The faces of the police detectives brightened, and their eyes grew sharp. I suppose mine did, too. There are many, many murders with never a woman in them anywhere; but seldom a very conspicuous killing. &#34;Who&#39;s this Miss Dexter?&#34; O&#39;Gar took up the inquiry. &#34;She&#39;s, well--&#34; Charles Gantvoort hesitated. &#34;Well, Father was on very friendly terms with her and her brother. He usually called on them--on her several evenings a week. In fact, I suspected that he intended marrying her.&#34; &#34;Who and what is she?&#34; &#34;Father became acquainted with them six or seven months ago. I&#39;ve met them several times, but don&#39;t know them very well. Miss Dexter--Creda is her given name--is about twenty-three years old, I should judge, and her brother Madden is four or five years older. He is in New York now, or on his way there, to transact some business for Father.&#34; &#34;Did your father tell you he was going to marry her?&#34; O&#39;Gar hammered away at the woman angle. &#34;No; but it was pretty obvious that he was very much--ah--infatuated. We had some words over it a few days ago--last week. Not a quarrel, you understand, but words. From the way he talked I feared that he meant to marry her.&#34; &#34;What do you mean &#39;feared&#39;?&#34; O&#39;Gar snapped at that word. Charles Gantvoort&#39;s pale face flushed a little, and he cleared his throat embarrassedly. &#34;I don&#39;t want to put the Dexters in a bad light to you. I don&#39;t think--I&#39;m sure they had nothing to do with Father&#39;s--with this. But I didn&#39;t care especially for them--didn&#39;t like them. I thought they were--well--fortune hunters, perhaps. Father wasn&#39;t fabulously wealthy, but he had considerable means. And, while he wasn&#39;t feeble, still he was past fifty-seven, old enough for me to feel that Creda Dexter was more interested in his money than in him.&#34; &#34;How about your father&#39;s will?&#34; &#34;The last one of which I have any knowledge--drawn up two or three years ago--left everything to my wife and me, jointly. Father&#39;s attorney, Mr. Murray Abernathy, could tell you if there was a later will, but I hardly think there was.&#34; &#34;Your father had retired from business, hadn&#39;t he?&#34; &#34;Yes; he turned his import and export business over to me about a year ago. He had quite a few investments scattered around, but he wasn&#39;t actively engaged in the management of any concern.&#34; O&#39;Gar tilted his village constable hat back and scratched his bullet head reflectively for a moment. Then he looked at me. &#34;Anything else you want to ask?&#34; &#34;Yes. Mr. Gantvoort, do you know or did you ever hear your father or anyone else speak of an Emil Bonfils?&#34; &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Did your father ever tell you that he had received a threatening letter? Or that he had been shot at on the street?&#34; &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Was your father in Paris in 1902?&#34; &#34;Very likely. He used to go abroad every year up until the time of his retirement from business. O&#39;Gar and I took Gantvoort around to the morgue to see his father, then. The dead man wasn&#39;t pleasant to look at, even to O&#39;Gar and me, who hadn&#39;t known him except by sight. I remembered him as a small wiry man, always smartly tailored, and with a brisk springiness that was far younger than his years. He lay now with the top of his head beaten into a red and pulpy mess. We left Gantvoort at the morgue and set out afoot for the Hall of Justice. &#34;What&#39;s this deep stuff you&#39;re pulling about Emil Bonfils and Paris in 1902?&#34; the detective-sergeant asked as soon as we were out in the street. &#34;This: the dead man phoned the Agency this afternoon and said he had received a threatening letter from an Emil Bonfils with whom he had had trouble in Paris in 1902. He also said that Bonfils had shot at him the previous evening, in the street. He wanted somebody to come around and see him about it tonight. And he said that under no circumstances were the police to be let in on it--that he&#39;d rather have Bonfils get him than have the trouble made public. That&#39;s all he would say over the phone; and that&#39;s how I happened to be on hand when Charles Gantvoort was notified of his father&#39;s death.&#34; O&#39;Gar stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and whistled softly. &#34;That&#39;s something!&#34; he exclaimed. &#34;Wait till we get back to headquarters--I&#39;ll show you something.&#34; Whipple was waiting in the assembly room when we arrived at headquarters. His face at first glance was as smooth and mask-like as when he had admitted me to the house on Russian Hill earlier in the evening. But beneath his perfect servant&#39;s manner he was twitching and trembling. We took him into the little office where we had questioned Charles Gantvoort. Whipple verified all that the dead man&#39;s son had told us. He was positive that neither the typewriter, the jewel case, the two cartridges, or the newer wallet had belonged to Gantvoort. We couldn&#39;t get him to put his opinion of the Dexters in words, but that he disapproved of them was easily seen. Miss Dexter, he said, had called up on the telephone three times this night at about eight o&#39;clock, at nine, and at nine-thirty. She had asked for Mr. Leopold Gantvoort each time, but she had left no message. Whipple was of the opinion that she was expecting Gantvoort, and he had not arrived. He knew nothing, he said, of Emil Bonfils or of any threatening letters. Gantvoort had been out the previous night from eight until midnight. Whipple had not seen him closely enough when he came home to say whether he seemed excited or not. Gantvoort usually carried about a hundred dollars in his pockets. &#34;Is there anything that you know of that Gantvoort had on his person tonight which isn&#39;t among these things on the desk?&#34; O&#39;Gar asked. &#34;No sir. Everything seems to be here--watch and chain, money, memorandum book, wallet, keys, handkerchiefs, fountain pen--everything that I know of.&#34; &#34;Did Charles Gantvoort go out tonight?&#34; &#34;No, sir. He and Mrs. Gantvoort were at home all evening.&#34; &#34;Positive?&#34; Whipple thought a moment. &#34;Yes, sir, I&#39;m fairly certain. But I know Mrs. Gantvoort wasn&#39;t out. To tell the truth, I didn&#39;t see Mr. Charles from about eight o&#39;clock until he came downstairs with this gentleman&#34;--pointing to me &#34;at eleven. But I&#39;m fairly certain he was home all evening. I think Mrs. Gantvoort said he was.&#34; Then O&#39;Gar put another question--one that puzzled me at the time. &#34;What kind of collar buttons did Mr. Gantvoort wear?&#34; &#34;You mean Mr. Leopold?&#34; &#34;Yes.&#34; &#34;Plain gold ones, made all in one piece. They had a London jeweler&#39;s mark on them.&#34; &#34;Would you know them if you saw them?&#34; &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; We let Whipple go home then. &#34;Don&#39;t you think,&#34; I suggested when O&#39;Gar and I were alone with this desk-load of evidence that didn&#39;t mean anything at all to me yet, &#34;it&#39;s time you were loosening up and telling me what&#39;s what?&#34; &#34;I guess so--listen! A man named Lagerquist, a grocer, was driving through Golden Gate park tonight, and passed a machine standing on a dark road, with its lights out. He thought there was something funny about the way the man in it was sitting at the wheel, so he told the first patrolman he met about it. &#34;The patrolman investigated and found Gantvoort sitting at the wheel--dead--with his head smashed in and this dingus&#34;--putting one hand on the bloody typewriter--&#34;on the seat beside him. That was at a quarter of ten. The doc says Gantvoort was killed--his skull crushed--with this typewriter. &#34;The dead man&#39;s pockets, we found, had all been turned inside out; and all this stuff on the desk, except this new wallet, was scattered about in the car--some of it on the floor and some on the seats. This money was there too--nearly a hundred dollars of it. Among the papers was this.&#34; He handed me a sheet of white paper upon which the following had been typewritten: L. F. G.-- I want what is mine. 6,000 miles and 21 years are not enough to hide you from the victim of your treachery. I mean to have what you stole. E. B.&#34;L. F. G. could be Leopold F. Gantvoort,&#34; I said. &#34;And E. B. could be Emil Bonfils. Twenty-one years is the time from 1902 to 1923, and 6,000 miles is, roughly, the distance between Paris and San Francisco.&#34; I laid the letter down and picked up the jewel case. It was a black imitation leather one, lined with white satin, and unmarked in any way. Then I examined the cartridges. There were two of them, S. W. .45-caliber, and deep crosses had been cut in their soft noses--an old trick that makes the bullet spread out like a saucer when it hits.</p><h2>This Night&#39;s Foul Work (A Commissaire Adamsberg Mystery)</h2><p><b>"Wry humor and offbeat plots blend with a subtly dangerous charm to make Fred Vargas the queen of French crime writers." &#x2014;Martin Walker, author of the Bruno, Chief of Police Series<br><br><b>&#x201c;A wildly imaginative series.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b></b><br><br>Awarded the International Dagger by the Crime Writers' Association four times, Fred Vargas has earned a reputation in Europe as a mystery author of the first order.

The newcomer, who was small and dark, had stripped to the waist despite the chilly March breeze and was building a wall of breeze-blocks without using a plumb line. After an hour&#x2019;s watching, Lucio shook his head abruptly, like a lizard emerging from its motionless siesta. He removed his unlit cigarette from his mouth.<br><br>&#x2018;That one,&#x2019; he said, pronouncing his final diagnosis, &#x2018;has no more ballast in his head than in his hands.

He was about to hold out his hand to shake when he saw that the man&#x2019;s right arm stopped short at the elbow.

Your house has nothing but tiles on the floor.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s right.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Not as warm as wood. Velasco&#x2019;s the name. Lucio Velasco Paz. The shop&#x2019;s called Velasco Paz and Daughter.&#x2019;<br><br>Lucio Velasco smiled broadly, but his gaze did not leave Adamsberg&#x2019;s face, inspecting it thoroughly. The old man was working up to an announcement. He had something to tell him.<br><br>&#x2018;Maria runs the business now. She&#x2019;s got a good head on her shoulders, so don&#x2019;t go running to her with stories, she doesn&#x2019;t like it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What sort of stories would those be?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Ghost stories, for instance,&#x2019; said the old man, screwing up his dark eyes.<br><br>&#x2018;No chance. I don&#x2019;t know any ghost stories.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;People say that, and then one day they do know one.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Maybe. For all I know. Your radio isn&#x2019;t tuned properly, <i>monsieur</i>. Would you like me to fix it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What for?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;To listen to the programmes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, <i>hombre</i>. I don&#x2019;t want to listen to their rubbish. At my age, you&#x2019;ve earned the right not to put up with it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, of course,&#x2019; said Adamsberg.<br><br>If the neighbour wanted to carry around in his pocket a radio that wasn&#x2019;t tuned to any programme, and call him &#x2018;hombre&#x2019;, that was up to him.<br><br>The old man staged another pause as he watched Adamsberg line up his breeze-blocks.<br><br>&#x2018;Like the house, do you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, very much.&#x2019;<br><br>Lucio made a joke under his breath and burst out laughing. Adamsberg smiled politely. There was something youthful about Lucio&#x2019;s laughter, whereas the rest of his demeanour suggested that he was more or less responsible for the destiny of mankind.<br><br>&#x2018;A hundred and fifty square metres.&#x2019; The old man was speaking again. &#x2018;With a garden, an open fireplace, a cellar, and a woodshed. You can&#x2019;t find anything like this in Paris nowadays. Did you ever ask yourself why it was going so cheap?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Because it&#x2019;s old and run-down, I suppose.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And did you never wonder why it hadn&#x2019;t been demolished either?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, it&#x2019;s at the end of a cul-de-sac &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not in anyone&#x2019;s way.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All the same,<i> hombre</i>. No buyer in the six years it&#x2019;s been on the market. Didn&#x2019;t that bother you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Monsieur Velasco, it takes a lot to bother me.&#x2019;<br><br>Adamsberg scraped off the surplus cement with his trowel.<br><br>&#x2018;Well, just suppose for a moment that it <i>did</i> bother you,&#x2019; insisted the old man. &#x2018;Suppose you asked yourself why nobody had bought this house.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Let me see. It&#x2019;s got an outside privy. People don&#x2019;t like that these days.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;They could have built an extension to reach it, as you&#x2019;re doing now.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not doing it for myself. It&#x2019;s for my wife and son.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;God&#x2019;s sakes, you&#x2019;re not going to bring a woman to live here, are you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, I don&#x2019;t think so. They&#x2019;ll just come now and then.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But this woman, your wife. She&#x2019;s not proposing to <i>sleep</i> here, is she?&#x2019;<br><br>Adamsberg frowned as the old man gripped his arm to gain his attention.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t go thinking you&#x2019;re stronger than anyone else,&#x2019; said the old man, more calmly. &#x2018;Sell up. These are things that pass our understanding. They&#x2019;re beyond our knowing.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What things?&#x2019;<br><br>Lucio shifted his now extinguished cigarette in his mouth.<br><br>&#x2018;See this?&#x2019; he said raising his right arm, which ended in a stump.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, said Adamsberg, with respect.<br><br>&#x2018;I lost that when I was nine years old, during the Civil War.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And sometimes it still itches. It itches on the part of my arm that isn&#x2019;t there, sixty-nine years later. In the same place, always the same place,&#x2019; said the old man, pointing to a space in the air. &#x2018;My mother knew why. It was the spider&#x2019;s bite. When I lost my arm, I hadn&#x2019;t finished scratching. So it goes on itching.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, I see,&#x2019; said Adamsberg, mixing his cement quietly.<br><br>&#x2018;Because the spider&#x2019;s bite hadn&#x2019;t finished its life &#x2014; do you understand what I&#x2019;m saying? It wants its dues, it&#x2019;s taking its revenge. Does that remind you of anything?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The stars,&#x2019; Adamsberg suggested. &#x2018;They go on shining long after they&#x2019;re dead.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All right, yes,&#x2019; admitted the old man, surprised. &#x2018;Or feelings. If a fellow goes on loving a girl, or the other way round, when it&#x2019;s all over, see what I mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But why does he go on loving the girl, or the other way round? What explains it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; said Adamsberg patiently.<br><br>Between gusts of wind, the hesitant March sunshine was warming his back, and he was quite happy to be there, building his wall in this overgrown garden. Lucio Velasco Paz could go on talking all he wanted, it wouldn&#x2019;t bother Adamsberg.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s quite simple. It&#x2019;s because the feeling hasn&#x2019;t run its course. It&#x2019;s beyond our control, that kind of thing. You have to wait for it to finish, go on scratching till the end. And if you die before you&#x2019;ve run your life&#x2019;s course, same thing. People who&#x2019;ve been murdered, they go on hanging about, their presence makes you itch non-stop.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Like spider ...</p><h2>The Steel Wave: A Novel of World War II</h2><p>Jeff Shaara, America&#x2019;s premier author of military historical fiction, brings us the centerpiece of his epic trilogy of the Second World War. <br><br>General Dwight Eisenhower once again commands a diverse army that must find its single purpose in the destruction of Hitler&#x2019;s European fortress. His primary subordinates, Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery, must prove that this unique blend of Allied armies can successfully confront the might of Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s forces, who have already conquered Western Europe. On the coast of France, German commander Erwin Rommel fortifies and prepares for the coming invasion, acutely aware that he must bring all his skills to bear on a fight his side must win. But Rommel&#x2019;s greatest challenge is to strike the Allies on his front, while struggling behind the lines with the growing insanity of Adolf Hitler, who thwarts the strategies Rommel knows will succeed. <br><br>Meanwhile, Sergeant Jesse Adams, a no-nonsense veteran of the 82nd Airborne, parachutes with his men behind German lines into a chaotic and desperate struggle. And as the invasion force surges toward the beaches of Normandy, Private Tom Thorne of the 29th Infantry Division faces the horrifying prospects of fighting his way ashore on a stretch of coast more heavily defended than the Allied commanders anticipate&#x2013;Omaha Beach. <br><br>From G.I. to general, this story carries the reader through the war&#x2019;s most crucial juncture, the invasion that altered the flow of the war, and, ultimately, changed history.</p><p><b>Jeff Shaara</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>A Chain of Thunder,</i>&nbsp;<i>A Blaze of Glory,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Final Storm, No Less Than Victory, The Steel Wave, The Rising Tide, To the Last Man, The Glorious Cause, Rise to Rebellion,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Gone for Soldiers,&nbsp;</i>as well as&nbsp;<i>Gods and Generals&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The Last Full Measure</i>&#x2014;two novels that complete the Civil War trilogy that began with his father&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning classic,&nbsp;<i>The Killer Angels</i>.

THE COMMANDO<br><br>At Sea, Bay of the Seine January 25, 1944<br><br>The air underwater was foul and wet, five men pulling against the thinning oxygen. He sat erect, his back painfully pressed against a coil of wire, part of the electrical system of the craft. She was an X-5 class midget submarine, designed to deliver a magnetic mine or similar explosive device, something to be attached to the bottom of an enemy ship. They were stealthy, of course, no blip on anyone&#x2019;s radar screen, so the British navy had used them on raids all along the coastline, from Norway to the Mediterranean, usually with enormous risk to both the subs and their small crews. But tonight the sub was not armed, and where explosives had once been stored she now carried three passengers and their equipment.<br><br>He tried to stretch his back&#x2014;no room&#x2014;and twisted his shoulders instead, working out the kinks. The air was growing worse, thin and acrid, bitter smells of oil and wet cloth. There were no dry places in the small sub, every surface had a slick coating of oily grease or water, mostly condensation. The engine made a low hum, deadened by the steel of the bulkhead, the sub lurching slowly from side to side, held now by long low waves that rolled silently toward the beaches.<br><br>&#x201c;Suit up, lads.&#x201d;<br><br>The voice was low, a croak from the lieutenant. He knew the order was coming, yanked hard at his small duffel bag, and retrieved it from the tight gap beneath his feet. Inside were all the tools he would need for the mission. The first priority was unrolling the tight spool of the rubber suit, a single piece, zipped open down the front. There was little room to stand, and he fought to slide the thin rubber over his legs, working his feet downward, pushing. He slid the suit beneath his bottom, pushed his arms into the narrow sleeves, freed his fingers, gave one loud grunt, and pulled the suit up over his shoulders. The others were grunting as he was, straining in the tight space, backs and arms bent low, each man forcing himself into his taut suit. He tried to relax, leaning back against the bulkhead, and took a breath, sour air filling his mouth, took another, felt his chest heave in a futile gasp. He was sweating, worse inside the suit, and the air was growing fouler still. No matter how the air cleaners strained, they were not designed to handle the nervous breathing of five men.<br><br>He leaned forward again, pulled the zipper tight against his neck, then tugged at the headpiece, sliding it over his ears, snug, only his face revealed. He reached again into the bag, found a small tube of grease, black and oily, squeezed a thick stream onto his fingers, and rubbed it on his face, coating any part that would reflect moonlight. The duffel was nearly empty now, but he found his knife, his only weapon, and strapped it to his leg, tight and secure, then went into the bag again for a small bundle, a cloth pouch attached to a thin belt, and slid it around his waist. The man beside him gave him a nudge with his elbow.<br><br>&#x201c;All set here. You all right, Dundee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep. You tight in? Ready?&#x201d;<br><br>The man slapped his hands on Dundee&#x2019;s leg. &#x201c;Ready as I&#x2019;ll ever be.&#x201d;<br><br>Dundee leaned forward, looked past, and said to the third man, &#x201c;Lieutenant? You set, then?&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant scanned both men. Dundee could see his face sweating, a dull wet mask, lit by the yellow glow from the sub&#x2019;s instrument panel. Then the officer began to smear his face with the black grease.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t concern yourselves with me. My job is to worry about you. And right now I&#x2019;m ready to get this little show moving.&#x201d;<br><br>From the main control seat, the sub&#x2019;s commander turned around toward them.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be on the surface in half a minute. On my command, Mr. Higgins will open the hatch, and out you go. Make it quick. I&#x2019;ll not chance there&#x2019;s some Jerry lookout who&#x2019;s good at his job. This tub won&#x2019;t take pleasantly to incoming fire, and the sooner I can drop us out of sight, the better I like it.&#x201d; He looked at his watch. &#x201c;Orders say two hours. I&#x2019;ll wait for three if I have to, but that&#x2019;s it. I&#x2019;m not about to sit out here and wait for the damned sun to come up. Sitting ducks, all of us. You got that?&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant pointed at his own watch. &#x201c;I know my orders, Cap- tain. We&#x2019;ll be back in two hours. Don&#x2019;t go off sightseeing. You&#x2019;ve got a periscope&#x2014;keep an eye in it. I don&#x2019;t plan to tread water any more than I have to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know my tub, Lieutenant. And we&#x2019;re lucky tonight. The surface is pretty smooth right now. A dicky bird swims within a hundred yards of me, I&#x2019;ll spot her. You just do the swimming; I&#x2019;ll see you.&#x201d;<br><br>Swimming. Dundee swallowed the word silently. Most of the commando operations were launched from surface crafts, LCNs, small and rugged navigation boats. The LCNs slipped in close to shore, depositing their commandos in folbots, folding canvas boats, flimsy canoes the men would paddle hard to the beach. But there was too much tide and too much current along this stretch of the French coastline, and a folbot might swamp and drown the men before they could even reach the shore. It was a painful lesson; several men had been lost already in earlier operations. Besides being a danger to her crew, a folbot had to be hidden from German patrols, patrols that were growing vigilant. And so, tonight, they would swim.<br><br>The captain turned toward his instruments and pulled a lever, the sub tilting upward, the bow rising. Dundee pushed his hands into the narrow metal seat, his back leaning hard against the tight coils, and tried to distract himself, thought suddenly of the captain&#x2019;s boast. What the hell is a dicky bird? The sub swayed, rolling to one side, then upright again, and Dundee&#x2019;s stomach rolled, the stink in the air filling his head with a dull pain, now growing worse. He heard the splashing of water against the bulkheads; the sub was level again, and the captain&#x2019;s lone crewman stood, his hands pressed upward against the narrow hatch, and stared forward toward his captain.<br><br>&#x201c;On your order, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Steady, Higgins. Not quite on the deck. Wait for it.&#x201d;<br><br>They sat quietly, feeling the low hum of the engine and, now, silence, the captain shutting down the engine. Dundee took a long breath, tried to ignore the sickening smell, his head pounding, a quiver in his hands. He shook his head, thought, All right, Henry, hold on to yourself. They taught you this. It&#x2019;s all about lack of oxygen. We&#x2019;ll be out of this damned can in a few&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Higgins.&#x201d;<br><br>The crewman pulled hard on a round crank: The hatch was suddenly open, cold air filling the cabin, a splash of water. The lieutenant stood, hunched over by the overhead close above him, moved toward the hatch, slapped the captain on the shoulder, said nothing. Dundee waited for the man beside him, Henley, up and moving, the well-rehearsed routine, Dundee close behind him. The air was cold and delicious; a blast against Dundee&#x2019;s face and the headache had vanished. He pressed forward, following the other two toward the blessed opening, watched the lieutenant pull himself up through the hatch, now just his legs and then gone. Henley followed quickly, up and out of the way, and Dundee grabbed the edges of the hatch and pulled himself up, his head clear of the dismal space. He was outside now, in cold darkness, and he pulled his knees up between his arms, thrust out his feet, sat on the edge of the hatchway, the deck of the sub narrow and flat. The water was black and silent, long low swells. Now came the splashes, the other two already swimming, the lieutenant leading the way, long strokes of his arms, already distancing himself from the sub, Henley trailing behind him. Dundee looked out that way, saw the shoreline, a vast shadow against the night sky. The sub suddenly rocked, caught by a swell, and Dundee released his hands, slid down, let the motion of the sub push him away, pressed his feet against the steel hull, and gave one sharp push, his arms and legs working the water, the training taking over. He moved with precise rhythm, his face bathed by the cold. He was a strong swimmer, essential for this job, slicing quickly through the water, lifted by more swells, the cold gone now, the strength returning, the power taking over: so many miles of swimming and running, months of lifting and climbing, all condensed into these long moments.<br><br>His brain kept count of the number of strokes, an exercise that might have no meaning at all. But in the dark, they would make this swim again, and if the captain was wrong, if the waves picked up or the surface became choppy, at least the men could swim out to within yards of where they had left the sub. It had always seemed to be a foolish gamble, but here, in the black water, it might be the only chance they had to be picked up again.<br><br>His brain ticked past three hundred strokes, and he paused, raised his head, scanned the shoreline, fought for a glimpse of the others, but there was nothing to see, dull blackness, new sounds in his ears, surf, gentle waves rolling forward. He swam again, pushed out sharp breaths, felt aching in his arms, his legs growing stiff, his chest heaving with each breath. Something rose up in front of him, a thin black shape, a man, standing and then dropping down again, crouched low, one hand pointed toward him, a signal, more of the training. Stand up.<br><br>Dundee eased his legs downward, his feet stopping on hard sand. He was breathing heavily, felt giddy, stupid, thought of the lieutenant, the man&#x2019;s face invisible in the darkness, laughing at him. Every time, he thought, every damned swimming drill, so many times before. Every officer had teased him about it: Dundee, the man who swims until the sand bumps his chin. He knew what the lieutenant was thinking, had heard it too many times. Yes, you can stop swimming, you idiot. It&#x2019;s three feet deep.<br><br>The three men moved close together, and Dundee stared at the beach, a wide stretch of flat sand, saw a fence row, posts, odd, his brain trying to understand. Fences? The lieutenant moved away, low in the water, crawling, moving up onto the sand, seeming to ignore the others, and Dundee followed, feeling his way with his hands. They were clear of the shallow surf, and the lieutenant kept himself low, began to run, heavy deliberate steps. There were no orders now, the training so familiar, and the others followed automatically. Dundee felt the sand hard beneath his feet, his footsteps echoing in small thumps, shallow puddles. He passed one of the fence posts, glanced up, saw it tilting outward, toward the open water, a small round hat on top. He understood from the briefings, drawings they had seen. They&#x2019;re not fence posts. It&#x2019;s low tide, and they&#x2019;re shore obstacles. And the hat on top? It&#x2019;s a mine.<br><br>The sand began to slope upward, the men climbing, the sand softer, beyond the high-water line, and Dundee kept running, felt the strength in his legs, his breaths heavy and sharp. The lieutenant stopped and knelt low, ducking behind a long low mound of rocks, something else from the briefings, another landmark. Then he pulled a small bundle from the pouch around his own waist, and Dundee understood. It was the tape, the fluorescent stringer that would guide their return, the only way they would ever find their way back to this point on the beach. Dundee watched him unroll it and anchor one end in the sand with a small metal spike. The lieutenant seemed to pause. All three men were breathing heavily, and Dundee heard a whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;Time to go to work, gents. Welcome to Omaha Beach.&#x201d;<br>They were one squad of the Combined Operations Assault Pilotage Party, a mouthful of description for the men who were sent ashore to find out just what the Allies might be facing on the beaches that had been designated for Operation Overlord. The training had begun months before at the enormous facility at Achnacarry, Scotland. Nearly every commando unit in the British army had received training at Achnacarry, and the Americans had gone as well, Darby&#x2019;s Rangers, men who had already been through the bloodiest days of the fights in the Mediterranean. Many of the commandos had been designated to make armed raids, landing in fleets of rubber rafts, attacking the enemy&#x2019;s seaside installations, ammo and supply dumps. Some of the raids were launched against various ports, other midget submarines slipping into the harbors to target German ships. Few of the raids had been terribly successful, and many of the Royal Navy&#x2019;s higher-ups considered the midget subs a dangerous waste of machines and good men. The X-5 class midgets had no defenses and could barely escape the enemy&#x2019;s spotter planes and fast-moving E-boats, but in the dark the subs could bring their commandos close to the shore, close enough for the folbots and, tonight, close enough for the men to swim.<br><br>Their mission was absurdly simple: Gather samples of the sand and rock on Omaha Beach. The beach itself was cut by four draws, deep ravines, passageways that led inland, dividing the high bluff into sections that the mapmakers had designated by various code names. But those ravines interested not just the infantry commanders but the engineers as well. Over the centuries, streams and floodwater had flown into the sea, and with it had come tons of silt. If that silt was too soft to support the weight of trucks, tanks, and other armored vehicles, an amphibious landing on Omaha Beach simply wouldn&#x2019;t work. The entire motorized portion of the invasion would grind to a halt, embedded in a mire that would make them stationary targets for the German artillery above.<br><br>The engineers had another concern as well, so more commandos had gone ashore on other nights with other objectives. Behind the bluffs, around the seaside villages of Colleville-sur-Mer and Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, the land was rich in history, a countryside once occupied by the Romans. But the Romans had left a mystery and, possibly, a deadly problem. The land along the Normandy coastline had often been used to farm and gather peat, thick layers of sod used for fuel and building material. The question had to be answered: Had the two-thousand-year-old peat bogs become vast pits of soft mud? For now, though, that wasn&#x2019;t Dundee&#x2019;s problem. His problem was keeping up with his lieutenant.<br><br>On this night, Dundee&#x2019;s mission had much more to do with engineering than combat, the men armed only with their knives, since any weapons fire was certain suicide. On the bluffs high above what the planners had named Omaha Beach, German gun emplacements, artillery pillboxes, and machine-gun nests covered the open sands below in what would certainly be interlocking fields of fire. Among the various outposts, German infantry had also been positioned, the Allied aerial reconnaissance showing miles of trench works. Any lookout who heard movement on the beach would know to fire a star shell or a Very light, which would bathe the beach in the glow of man-made sunshine for deadly seconds. As much as Dundee felt the itch to have his pistol handy, tonight there could be no firefight. Just do the job and then find that precious line of tape and make your way back into the surf, all the while praying the midget sub&#x2019;s captain could find you in the black water.<br>They moved across the sand in total silence, even the gentle surf too far away. Dundee knew the timetable, the tide expected to rise well before dawn, but to a level he found hard to believe. The training taught them that the tide here rose eight feet or more, and in a few short hours, the flat plain of hard sand they had run across would be completely submerged. The high tide would provide a fatal disguise, submerging the posts, the steel girders and wooden poles capped by the mines. As the tide came in, the distance they had to swim would lengthen by hundreds of yards. But it woul...</p><h2>Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots</h2><p>Most Americans know Patrick Henry as a fiery speaker whose pronouncement Give me liberty or give me death!&#x201d; rallied American defiance to the British Crown. But Henry's skills as an orator sharpened in the small towns and courtrooms of colonial Virginia are only one part of his vast, but largely forgotten, legacy. As historian Thomas S. Kidd shows, Henry cherished a vision of America as a virtuous republic with a clearly circumscribed central government. These ideals brought him into bitter conflict with other Founders and were crystallized in his vociferous opposition to the U.S. Constitution.<p> In <i>Patrick Henry</i>, Kidd pulls back the curtain on one of our most radical, passionate Founders, showing that until we understand Henry himself, we will neglect many of the Revolution's animating values.</p></p><p>An Associate Professor of History at Baylor University, winner of a 2006&#x2013;2007 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, and author of numerous books on American religious history, <b>Thomas S. Kidd</b> lives in Waco, Texas.<b>Daniel L. Dreisbach, American University and author of <i>Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State</i></b><br> Few characters of the American Revolution are more celebrated and, yet, less understood than Patrick Henry. &nbsp;In this vivid portrait of the firebrand orator, Thomas S. Kidd scrapes away the myths and misconceptions that have long obscured our understanding of Henry, revealing a patriot of uncommon conviction, vision, and, yes, contradictions. &nbsp;This engaging biography offers rich insights into not only Henry's controversial life but also the tumultuous age and fractured society in which he lived a world turned upside down by the cruel institution of slavery, religious revivals and disestablishment, a bitter separation from Great Britain, and the creation of a new nation.&#x201d;<br><b>Richard Beeman, John Welsh Centennial Professor of History, University of Pennsylvania, and author of <i>Plain, Honest Men: The Making of the American Constitution</i></b><br> Thomas Kidd's account of the life of Patrick Henry combines first-rate scholarship with a lively and elegant gift for story-telling.&nbsp; It makes a powerful case for the Virginia orator's pre-eminent role in the fight to limit central government power during the era of the Revolution and early republic.&#x201d;<br><br><br><br><b>Wilfred M. McClay, SunTrust Chair of Excellence in Humanities, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga</b><br> We've long needed this book, a fresh look at the life of Patrick Henry, the&nbsp; forest-born Demosthenes&#x201d; who became one of the most eminent of American&nbsp;patriots, and one of the greatest orators and phrasemakers of early American&nbsp;history. His historical reputation has suffered somewhat because of his&nbsp;opposition to the Constitution, but as Thomas Kidd shows in this vivid and&nbsp;lucid new biography, that judgment fails to do him justice.

The Secret Societies, Symbols, Bloodlines and The New World Order</h2><p>Hidden behind the veil of their secret society the group known as the Illuminati have still managed to garner great attention and acclaim. They have been blamed for everything imaginable such as being the igniting force behind the French Revolution and being the real masterminds behind the 9/11 attacks. They have even been credited with assassinating both Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy, because these two celebrated presidents made the unfortunate mistake of trying to usurp their unquestionable power. The so called conspiracy theorists say that they are hell bent on ushering in their new world order which consists of the establishment of a one world government, a one world army and destroying the sovereignty of every nation. They are said to be implementing their New World Order through organizations they are identified with as being part of like The Bilderberg Group, The Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission, The Club of Rome and many others. There are prominent families who are also said to be part of the Illuminati like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. But are these assertions valid? Does popular society have it right or have they simply misunderstood this secret group? Have they been given a bad rap? In his revealing book entitled Who Are The Illuminati: The Secret Societies, Symbols, Bloodlines and The New World Order author Frank White takes a critical look at this powerful underground secret society, who they are and what their intentions are in a world filled with scorn for them. He explores not only the true facts about the group, but also the urban legends attributed to them, some of which are true and others of which have been greatly exaggerated. For example, do they really control the world and everyone else are just slaves to their whims and madness? Do they have a stranglehold on the entertainment and music industries and are the popular stars just puppets carrying out their agenda to the masses? Did they really order the murder of pop superstar Michael Jackson? These questions and many more will be answered in this explosive book.</p><p></p><h2>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian (10th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p>Bestselling author Sherman Alexie tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Determined to take his future into his own hands, Junior leaves his troubled school on the rez to attend an all-white farm town high school where the only other Indian is the school mascot.<br><br>Heartbreaking, funny, and beautifully written, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, which is based on the author's own experiences, coupled with poignant drawings by Ellen Forney that reflect the character's art, chronicles the contemporary adolescence of one Native American boy as he attempts to break away from the life he was destined to live.<br><br>With a forward by Markus Zusak, interviews with Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney, and four-color interior art throughout, this edition is perfect for fans and collectors alike.<br></p><p>An award-winning author, poet, and filmmaker, Sherman Alexie was named one of GRANTA's Best Young American Novelists and has been lauded by <i>The Boston Globe</i> as "an important voice in American literature." One of the most well known and beloved literary writers of his generation, his works of fiction, including <i>Thunder Boy Jr.</i>, <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>, <i>Reservation Blues</i> and short story collections <i>Ten Little Indians</i> and <i>The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</i>, have received numerous awards and citations. He lives in Seattle.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;Exploring Indian identity, both self and tribal, Alexie's first young adult novel is a semiautobiographical chronicle of Arnold Spirit, aka Junior, a Spokane Indian from Wellpinit, WA. The bright 14-year-old was born with water on the brain, is regularly the target of bullies, and loves to draw. He says, "I think the world is a series of broken dams and floods, and my cartoons are tiny little lifeboats." He expects disaster when he transfers from the reservation school to the rich, white school in Reardan, but soon finds himself making friends with both geeky and popular students and starting on the basketball team. Meeting his old classmates on the court, Junior grapples with questions about what constitutes one's community, identity, and tribe. The daily struggles of reservation life and the tragic deaths of the protagonist's grandmother, dog, and older sister would be all but unbearable without the humor and resilience of spirit with which Junior faces the world. The many characters, on and off the rez, with whom he has dealings are portrayed with compassion and verve, particularly the adults in his extended family. Forney's simple pencil cartoons fit perfectly within the story and reflect the burgeoning artist within Junior. Reluctant readers can even skim the pictures and construct their own story based exclusively on Forney's illustrations. The teen's determination to both improve himself and overcome poverty, despite the handicaps of birth, circumstances, and race, delivers a positive message in a low-key manner. Alexie's tale of self-discovery is a first purchase for all libraries.&#x2014;<i>Chris Shoemaker, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why don't I see any progress? What am I doing wrong?</strong></em> Do you ever feel like you are walking in spiritual circles? While we might think it would be different for a Franciscan priest, Father Albert Haase shares the same struggles. And yet he also affirms that we are all called to be ordinary mystics, who, in the words of his own spiritual director, are "ordinary Christians who do what we are all called to do: respond to grace." Learning to be a mystic is about cultivating a life with God in which we draw close, listen, and respond moment to moment. We know we will fail at times, but we can also be certain that we follow a God who never stops reaching out to us. This book offers a daily path to making the connection.</p><p>Albert Haase, OFM, is a preacher, teacher, and spiritual director. A former missionary to mainland China for over eleven years, he is the award-winning author of ten books on popular spirituality and the presenter on five bestselling DVDs. He holds a PhD in historical theology from Fordham University and an MDiv from Catholic Theological Union. He is currently serving as chaplain at Cedarbrake Retreat Center near Austin, Texas."With scriptural insights and practical exercises, Albert Haase reminds us that God has an ardent longing for a deeper and deeper relationship with each of us. The disciple's journey is a mystical journey that leads to a deeper experience of the ordinary and mundane. To plumb the depths of the secular is to scale the heights of the sacred. An authentic expression of the Franciscan vision of the world!" (Richard Rohr, Center for Action and Contemplation)<br><br>"In <em>Becoming an Ordinary Mystic</em>, Father Haase has painted a sublimely practical picture of what it might look like to pursue life with Christ in the details of commonplace living. This book is an encouragement to live in the now, reflect on the why, and live purposefully in his presence." (Manuel Luz, creative arts pastor, author of Honest Worship)<br><br>"A deeply personal and intimate look at what it means to be a mystic. Father Albert invites us to dive deep and unlock the mysteries of our faith. If we are willing to make the descent, Fr. Albert guides all of us on an adventure rooted in the depths of our heart. It is simple, insightful, and life giving." (Chuck Neff, host of The Inner Life, Relevant Radio)<br><br>"Franciscan Albert Haase is a master storyteller. Throughout <em>Becoming an Ordinary Mystic</em> his pithy, down-to-earth anecdotes draw a reader in. But these tales have a decided plumb line. Into them he skillfully weaves insights from Christian wisdom figures&#x2015;from Job to Teresa of �vila to Thomas Merton. What emerges is a surprisingly accessible guide to a mature Christian life saturated with the divine presence. The author gives thoughtful attention to classic spiritual arts of awareness, listening, attentiveness, forgiveness, apophatic and kataphatic prayer as well as experiences of dark night, sin, fear, doubt, and mercy, all while grounding enduring truths in real life using arresting allusions to Haase's own struggles and the struggles of those he ministered to." (Wendy M. Wright, professor emerita of theology, Creighton University)<br><br>"Albert Haase holds keen insight for the subtleties of the spiritual journey. His guidance gently leads us along the path that makes meaning out of our life." (Phileena Heuertz, founding partner of Gravity, a Center for Contemplative Activism, author of Mindful Silence and Pilgrimage of a Soul)<br><br>"Belief does not come as naturally for many of us as it did for our parents and grandparents. A world without God seems a live option. So if we are to believe, we will need to be people who have experienced a living God, people who are ordinary mystics. With lucidity, candor, and warmth, Father Haase helps us understand that while being an ordinary mystic isn't necessarily easy, it is simple, and he shows us how to become one." (Austin Fischer, lead pastor of Vista Community Church, author of Faith in the Shadows)<br><br>"Want to be a mystic? I didn't, until I read what Father Albert has to say about this surprisingly accessible way of perceiving the road we're traveling. In this short book, you'll find yourself reading along with some of the greatest minds of the church. You'll recognize yourself in the stories, grow through the training exercises, and be inspired by the invitation to claim your inner mystic. And will you become, in the end, one of those blessed ones? That's up to you." (Alice Camille, coauthor of Fearless: Stories of the American Saints)<br><br>"We are mystics because we are called to a relationship with God and to live that intimacy God desires with every person. So this is the book many folks have been waiting for. In ordinary language with great examples and stories of real people, Father Haase leads us to understand the spiritual journey in ways that truly touch the heart. Each chapter concludes with an exercise to practice, reflect, and ponder, which I found very helpful. Surely most of us want to become ordinary mystics and this work encourages us to continue seeking the deeper life with God."

There in the perfect bowl of the night sky, untouched by light from any human source, a thunderstorm sends its premonitory signal and begins a slow journey to the observer, who thinks: the world is about to change.&#x201d; Watching from the edge of the Brazilian rain forest, witness to the sort of violence nature visits upon its creatures, Edward O. Wilson reflects on the crucible of evolution, and so begins his remarkable account of how the living world became diverse and how humans are destroying that diversity.</p><p>Wilson, internationally regarded as the dean of biodiversity studies, conducts us on a tour through time, traces the processes that create new species in bursts of adaptive radiation, and points out the cataclysmic events that have disrupted evolution and diminished global diversity over the past 600 million years. The five enormous natural blows to the planet (such as meteorite strikes and climatic changes) required 10 to 100 million years of evolutionary repair. The sixth great spasm of extinction on earth&#x2015;caused this time entirely by humans&#x2015;may be the one that breaks the crucible of life. Wilson identifies this crisis in countless ecosystems around the globe: coral reefs, grasslands, rain forests, and other natural habitats. Drawing on a variety of examples such as the decline of bird populations in the United States, the extinction of many species of freshwater fish in Africa and Asia, and the rapid disappearance of flora and fauna as the rain forests are cut down, he poignantly describes the death throes of the living world&#x2019;s diversity&#x2015;projected to decline as much as 20 percent by the year 2020.</p><p>All evidence marshaled here resonates through Wilson&#x2019;s tightly reasoned call for a spirit of stewardship over the world&#x2019;s biological wealth. He makes a plea for specific actions that will enhance rather than diminish not just diversity but the quality of life on earth. Cutting through the tangle of environmental issues that often obscure the real concern, Wilson maintains that the era of confrontation between forces for the preservation of nature and those for economic development is over; he convincingly drives home the point that both aims can, and must, be integrated. Unparalleled in its range and depth, Wilson&#x2019;s masterwork is essential reading for those who care about preserving the world biological variety and ensuring our planet&#x2019;s health.</p></p><p>Humans, the Harvard University entomologist Edward O. Wilson has observed, have an innate--or at least extremely ancient--connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only "a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy" with nature, but also our very sanity. In <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, Wilson takes a sweeping view of our planet's natural richness, remarking on what on the surface seems a paradox: "almost all the species that ever lived are extinct, and yet more are alive today than at any time in the past." (Wilson's elegant explanation is a scientific education in itself.) This great variety of species is, of course, threatened by habitat destruction, global climate change, and a host of other forces, and Wilson revisits his oft-stated call for the protection of wilderness and undeveloped land, noting that "wilderness has virtue unto itself and needs no extraneous justification." We should, he continues, regard every species, "every scrap of biodiversity," as precious and irreplaceable, without attempting to quantify that regard with utilitarian measures such as "bio-economics." In short, Wilson offers with this book a simple, workable environmental ethic that extends the work of Aldo Leopold and other conservationists. A remarkably productive and influential scientist, Wilson is also a fine writer, and his survey of biodiversity makes for welcome and instructive reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Edward O. Wilson is Pellegrino University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In addition to two Pulitzer Prizes (one of which he shares with Bert H�lldobler), Wilson has won many scientific awards, including the National Medal of Science and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2>What If Jesus Meant What He Said?</h2><p>What if Jesus words were never intended to fit into your existing lifestyle?

"This is Mr. Huxley's Hollywood novel, and you might expect it to be fantastic, extravagant, crazy and preposterous.

Dee.A comedic novel written by Aldous Huxley. Published in 1939 under the title After Many a Summer, the novel was republished under its current title later in the same year. Written soon after Huxley left England and settled in California, the novel is Huxley&#39;s examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its narcissism, superficiality, and obsession with youth. The title is a line from Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#39;s poem &#34;Tithonus,&#34; about a figure from Greek mythology to whom Zeus gave eternal life but not eternal youth. In Huxley&#39;s novel, California millionaire Jo Stoyte learns of an English nobleman who discovered a way to vastly extend the human life span. Stoyte travels to England and finds the nobleman still alive, but he has devolved into an apelike creature. Stoyte decides to extend his life regardless of the consequences. --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</p><h2>Chess Openings: Traps And Zaps: Traps And Zaps (Fireside Chess Library)</h2><p>Fireside Chess Library <br> In the first completely instructional book ever written on chess openings, National Master Bruce Pandolfini teaches players how to take charge of the game's crucial opening phase. <br> Of the three traditional phases of chess play -- the opening, the middle-game and the endgame -- the opening is the phase average players confront most often. Unfortunately, though, many openings are not completed successfully, partly because until now most opening instruction has consisted of tables of tournament level moves that offer no explanations for the reasons behind them. Consequently, these classical opening patterns can serve as little more than references to the average player. <br> In <i>Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps,</i> Bruce Pandolfini uses his unique "crime and punishment" approach to provide all the previously missing explanation, instruction, practical analyses, and much, much more. The book consists of 202 short "openers" typical of average players, arranged according to the classical opening variations and by level of difficulty. Each example includes: <br> <b>* the name of the overriding tactic<br> * the name of the opening<br> * a scenario that sets up the tactic to be learned<br> * an interpretation that explains why the loser went wrong, how he could have avoided the trap, and what he should have done instead<br> * a review of important principles and useful guidelines to reinforce each lesson.</b> <br> Also included are a glossary of openings that lists all the classical "textbook" variations for comparison and reference and a tactical index. <i>Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps</i> is a powerful, pragmatic entry into a heretofore remote area of chess theory that will have a profound influence on every player's game.</p><p>Bruce Pandolfini is the author of eight instructional chess books, including Bobby Fischer&#39;s Outrageous Chess Moves, Principles of the New Chess, Pandolfini&#39;s Endgame Course, Russian Chess, The ABC&#39;s of Chess, Let&#39;s Play Chess, Kasparov&#39;s Winning Chess Tactics, and One-Move Chess by the Champions. He is also editor of the distinguished anthologies, The Best of Chess Life, Volumes I and II.

For the developing student, this group of openings is an excellent training ground in tactics and active piece play.<br><br>In the <i>Center Game</i> (1. <b>e4 e5</b> 2. <b>d4 exd4</b> 3. <b>Qxd4)</b> White contents himself with knocking out the e5-pawn, Black's foothold in the center. White then regains this pawn by capturing on d4 with his Queen. Such an early Queen move is theoretically a liability, and after 3....Nc6, White indeed must back the Queen out of the center, losing time. Despite this drawback, the Center Game offers White reasonably good chances, and Black must play energetically in midcourt to secure equality.<br><br>The <i>Danish Gambit</i> (1. <b>e4 e5.</b> 2. <b>d4 exd4</b> 3. <b>c3 dxc3</b> 4. <b>Bc4 cxb2</b> 5. <b>Bxb2)</b> is an entirely different kettle of fish. Here, White sacrifices two pawns to accelerate development. This is not a humble opening, and if White fails to generate sufficient attacking possibilities, he will will simply be two pawns down with no compensation. Black, lacking development, must defend carefully. Rather than clinging too greedily to his extra pawns, he should return one or both of them to mobilize his forces. Otherwise, White's attack becomes irresistible.<br><br>The <i>Goring Gambit</i> (1. <b>e4 e5</b> 2. <b>Nf3 Nc6</b> 3. <b>d4 exd4</b> 4. <b>c3)</b> is closely related to the Danish Gambit, with the accent again on expeditious development. Here, White generally restricts himself to sacrificing only one pawn, thus minimizing much of the risk entailed in the Danish. Black, in theory, ought to be able to grab the pawn and endure White's attack. In practice, however, it's not so easy to keep White off his back.<br><br>The <i>Scotch Gambit</i> (1. <b>e4 e5</b> 2. <b>Nf3 Nc6</b> 3. <b>d4 exd4</b> 4. <b>Bc4)</b> resembles the Goring Gambit, with the sacrifice of a single pawn for speedy development. Exactly what constitutes a Scotch Gambit is not so clear to the casual player. In practice, this opening almost always transposes into other openings: Two Knights Defense, Max Lange Attack, Giuoco Piano, and even the Goring Gambit. It is often perceived as a transitional opening leading to a complex of related openings. One might play it to disguise one's true intentions.<br><br>The <i>Scotch Game</i> (1. <b>e4 e5</b> 2. <b>Nf3 Nc6</b> 3. <b>d4 exd4</b> 4. <b>Nxd4)</b> is White's attempt to enjoy the benefits of the Center Game without incurring its disadvantage: the premature exposure of White's Queen. With a pawn on e4 and a Knight on d4, White has the makings of a powerfully centralized game, and Black must conscientiously combine development and counterattack before White consolidates these assests into a concrete, permanent advantage. In theory, Black can pound away at squares e4 and d4, shaking White's grip on the center and ultimately achieving the freeing advance of his Queen-pawn from d7 to d5. This spirited thrust will allow Black to enter the middlegame on an even keel.<br><br><b>1<br><br>IN-BETWEEN MOVE<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Qxd4 Nf6</b><br><br>4. <b>Bg5 Be7</b><br><br>5. <b>e5?<br><br>Scenario:</b> White wants to attack the f6-Knight, but he overlooked 5....<b>Nc6,</b> assailing White's Queen and e-pawn. There are three safe squares for the Queen that also defend the pawn: c3, e3, and f4. If 6. Qc3, then 6....Bb4 pins White's Queen to its King. If 6. Qe3, then 6....Ng4 7. Qe4 (or 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Qe4 Ngxe5) 7....Ngxe5 gains the e5-pawn. And if 6. Qf4, then 6....Nh5 7. Qf3 (or 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 wins the e-pawn next move) 7....Bxg5 8. Qxh5 Bc1 9.Nd2 Bxb2 10. Rb1 Bxe5 puts Black two pawns ahead.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> White's second move, d2-d4, is designed to take control of the center, but the plan could backfire. White's Queen can be sucked into the central zone prematurely, after which it is subject to harassment from Black's developing army. Instead of the unprepared advance 5.e5, White should have brought out his b1-Knight, defending his e4-pawn. Afterward, he may be able to castle Queenside. Don't start attacking if you can't follow through with muscle. First build your game by rapid development. Then feast on your opponent's targets and weaknesses. Moreover, don't rely too much on the Queen. Before bringing it out, develop a couple of minor pieces.<br><br><b>2<br><br>PIN<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Qxd4 Nc6</b><br><br>4. <b>Qa4 Nf6</b><br><br>5. <b>Nc3 d5</b><br><br>6. <b>Bg5 dxe4</b><br><br>7. <b>Nxe4 Qe7</b><br><br>8. <b>0-0-0 Qxe4<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black's Queen seems protected by his f6-Knight, but not forever. White disrupts with 9. <b>Rd8+!.</b> Black's c6-Knight can't take White's Rook because it's pinned to Black's King by White's Queen. If 9....<b>Kxd8</b> (or 9....Ke7 10. Qxe4+) 10. <b>Qxe4,</b> then Black's f6-Knight, now in a pin, cannot take the Queen back. Black says goodbye to his Queen.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> If your King is still uncastled, avoid opening the center, giving your opponent some access to your fettered monarch. And at the very least, don't initiate risky captures that aid the enemy's attack. Black gauged that his Queen was adequately guarded by the f6-Knight after 8....Qxe4, but he neglected to consider what White's Rook check could do. Before inaugurating a combination or sequence of moves, try to evaluate the consequences of all your opponent's reasonable checks. They could force you to change your plans completely.<br><br><b>3<br><br>IN-BETWEEN MOVE<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Qxd4 Nc6</b><br><br>4. <b>Qe3 g6</b><br><br>5. <b>Nc3 Bg7</b><br><br>6. <b>Nd5 Nge7</b><br><br>7. <b>Ne2 d6</b><br><br>8. <b>Bd2 Bxb2</b><br><br>9. <b>Bc3 Bxa1<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black probably expects White to take his dark-square Bishop, which has grabbed White's Rook, but life isn't always tit for tat. Rather than capture on a1, White's rude Knight intercedes with a check, 10. <b>Nf6+.</b> After the obligatory 10....<b>Kf8,</b> White ends Black's torment with 11. <b>Qh6</b> mate.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> When you've flanked your King's Bishop, you probably can't exchange it away without incurring Kingside weaknesses. Especially vulnerable are the squares traveled by the Bishop -- for Black, the dark squares. The f6 and h6 squares are already weakened here by the g7-pawn's early advance. Once Black's dark-square Bishop also is shut out, those squares become indefensible. That's why it's prudent to think hard before exchanging the flanked King's Bishop, even if it wins a pawn. If you can get away with it, fine; but here, White actually wins by exploiting the undefended f6 with a Knight and also the abandoned h6 with his Queen. Be chary about early, impulsive pawn moves since they usually bring on enemy attack. As Marcus Aurelius put it, "What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee."<br><br><b>4<br><br>MATING ATTACK<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Qxd4 Nc6</b><br><br>4. <b>Qe3 Bb4+</b><br><br>5. <b>c3 Ba5</b><br><br>6. <b>Bc4 Nge7</b><br><br>7. <b>Qg3 0-0</b><br><br>8. <b>h4 Ng6<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black has castled into a furious assault. No prisoners are taken after 9. h5, driving away Black's Kingside shelter. If the g6Knight flees to e7, then 10. Bh6 capitalizes on a debilitating pin. So Black continues 9....<b>Nge5,</b> when 10. <b>Bg5!</b> pushes Black's Queen to a meaningless square, 10....<b>Qe8,</b> making it impossible for that piece to lend defense from f6. And here came more surprises, for 11. <b>Bf6 g6</b> 12. <b>hxg6 Nxg6</b> is refuted by 13. <b>Qxg6+! hxg6</b> 14. <b>Rh8</b> mate.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> Black's troubles were manifold. Though tactically the early b4-Bishop check works out fine, it weakens Black's Kingside, especially the square g7. In the final position, White's dark-square Bishop runs roughshod over g7 and h8, made possible by Black's aloof dark-square Bishop placement. The King-Knight's defensive abilities are also not so good from square e7. It would have been more enterprising to develop this piece to f6. Black, too, castles into a powerful attack force spearheaded by the h-pawn. Moving it up, White introduces his h1-Rook with deadly effect. Near the end, White's c4-Bishop holds the key, for it pins Black's f7 pawn, preventing it from capturing on g6. It's amazing that Black lasts even fourteen moves.<br><br><b>5<br><br>FORK<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Oxd4 Nc6</b><br><br>4. <b>Qe3 Nf6</b><br><br>5. <b>Bc4 Ne5</b><br><br>6. <b>Bb3 Bb4+</b><br><br>7. <b>c3 Bc5</b><br><br>8. <b>Qg3?<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black lays a trap, and White falls into it. White's Queen is history after 8....<b>Bxf2+!,</b> forking White's King and Queen. No matter what White answers, his Queen goes: (A) 9.Qxf2 Nd3+, Knight-forking White's King and Queen; (B) 9. Kxf2 Nxe4+, again Knight-forking White's royal pair.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> White bought a couple of bad raps here. First, he should have answered Black's fourth-move b4-Bishop check by 5. Bd2. It's usual to respond to a premature check by the KingBishop by blocking with a pawn. That compels the Bishop to move again to save itself, which causes your opponent to waste a turn. So White naturally responded with 7.c2-c3. This mechanical move weakened the d3 square, leaving it without pawn protection. In one of the winning lines, Black's e5-Knight exploits this square. White could have avoided loss of his Queen even after that, however, for there was no need to play 8.Qe3-g3. The simple retreat 4. Qe3-e2 would have averted disaster. One might play White's final blunder, 8. Qe3-g3, because it is natural to move the Queen aggressively, since its great power is always uppermost in the mind. But in the opening, the Queen's value actually makes it a liability. Bring it out early and your opponent can attack it and force you to waste time saving it. Don't develop the Queen early without a good reason.<br><br><b>6<br><br>REMOVING THE GUARD<br><br>Center Game</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Qxd4 Nc6</b><br><br>4. <b>Qe3 Nf6</b><br><br>5. <b>Nc3 Be7</b><br><br>6. <b>Bd2 d5</b><br><br>7. <b>exd5 Nb4</b><br><br>8. <b>0-0-0 Nfxd5</b><br><br>9. <b>Nxd5 Nxa2+<br><br>Scenario:</b> White's move, 10. <b>Kb1,</b> is forced, but it wins.

Kxe7</b> 13. <b>Bxb4+ Ke6</b> 14. <b>Bc4.</b> In the end, White stays a piece ahead.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> Black got terribly greedy while his King was in the center, where White's S.W.A.T team could get at it. Knight-pawns and Rook-pawns tend to bring on a hullabaloo. Too often, taking them means putting your pieces out of play, wasting time, and pushing your King out on a high wire. Black was doing fine until he got sidetracked by White's a2-pawn. But a simple recapture on d5 restores his excellent chances.<br><br><b>7<br><br>TRAPPED PIECE<br><br>Center Gambit</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Bc4 Qh4</b><br><br>4. <b>Qe2 Bb4+</b><br><br>5. <b>c3 dxc3</b><br><br>6. <b>bxc3 Bc5</b><br><br>7. <b>Nf3 Qh5<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black's Queen wobbles on the board's edge -- an area where her mobility is restricted. White tackles her poor position with a series of troublesome threats. The starting move is 8. <b>g4!.</b> Black can try to save his Queen in several ways: (A) 8....Qg6 9. Ne5, and after Black's Queen moves, White's Knight takes on f7 and then on h8; (B) 8....Qxg4 9. Bxf7+ Kf8 (if instead 9....Kxf7, then 10. Ne5+ forks King and Queen) 10. Rgl Qh3 11. Rg3, and Black's Queen falls; (C) 8....Qh3 9. Bxf7+ Kf8 10. Rgl, followed by 11. Rg3, again trapping and winning Black's Queen.<br><br>Interpretation: inexperienced players are prone to early Queen sorties. They get it out there for impractical reasons. in the opening, the odds are a developed Queen will become a liability instead of a strength, so often the Queen is best left well enough alone on its home square in the early stages. Naturally, this rule like any other has limitations and exceptions. Black's third move, Qd8-h4, though respectable, suggests that Black does not understand how to use his Queen. His real error came at move 7, when his Queen treaded into no-man's-land. Had he played Qh4-e7 instead, the chances in the position would have been about even. In the opening, don't bring out your Queen early without clear and specific reasons. Try to develop your minor pieces first. As an old West Fourth Street (New York) park player used to say, "The Queen is a symphony. Play your preludes first."<br><br><b>8<br><br>MATING ATTACK<br><br>Center Gambit</b><br><br>1. <b>e4 e5</b><br><br>2. <b>d4 exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>Nf3 Bb4+</b><br><br>4. <b>c3 dxc3</b><br><br>5. <b>bxc3 Bc5</b><br><br>6. <b>Bc4 d5</b><br><br>7. <b>Bxd5 Of6</b><br><br>8. <b>Bg5 Qg6<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black has put his head into the lion's mouth and the jaws are about to close. After 9. <b>Bxf7+! Kf8</b> (getting mated by 9....Qxf7 10. Qd8 and losing the Queen by 9....Kxf7 10. Ne5+ are not particularly appealing to Black either) 10. <b>Qd8+ Kxf7</b> 11. <b>Ne5+ Ke6,</b> White has the convenient 12. <b>Qd5</b> mate.<br><br><b>Interpretation:</b> Black did some questionable things and White answered with a mating attack. Black's Bishop-check on move 3 was not lucrative, since the piece had to move again after it was attacked. Better to get out the King-Knight first instead of the KingBishop (remember, Knights before Bishops). And why budge the Queen on move 7? Even though it would not greatly improve his game, Black should have developed his g8-Knight instead. The Queen should be handled like fine china. It must receive careful development. You may think the Queen is the one piece you know how to use, but you're probably wrong. How can you understand the Queen when the pieces that truly constitute the Queen's power -- the Rook and Bishop -- escape your notice? Chess is pure reason; you can't get anywhere without reason in chess. "As it isn't, it ain't. That's logic," said Tweedledee in Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i><br><br><b>9<br>MATING ATTACK<br><br>Danish Gambit</b><br><br>1. <b>el ebb</b><br><br>2. <b>dx exd4</b><br><br>3. <b>cb dxc3</b><br><br>4. <b>Bc4 Bb4</b><br><br>5. <b>bxc3 Be7?<br><br>Scenario:</b> Black's last move, 5....<b>Be7,</b> is a bleating mistake, for he could not afford to block the e7 square because his Queen might have had needed access to protect f7. White forces a winning game by 6. <b>Qd5,</b> when Black can't defend f7 with 6....Nh6, for White merely captures the h6-Knight with his cl-Bishop; and Black can't recapture on h6 because mate at f7 would still be menaced.

When your opponent takes back your material, he must cede at least one move to do that. If you can build your game while he's capturing, you should wrest away the initiative. If the position is reasonable, at the very least you will blunt his attack.

For weeks in Antarctica, Douglas Mawson faced some of the most daunting conditions ever known to man: blistering wind, snow, and cold; loss of his companion, his dogs and supplies, the skin on his hands and the soles of his feet; thirst, starvation, disease, snowblindness - and he survived. <br>Sir Douglas Mawson is remembered as the young Australian who would not go to the South Pole with Robert Scott in 1911, choosing instead to lead his own expedition on the less glamorous mission of charting nearly 1,500 miles of Antarctic coastline and claiming its resources for the British Crown. His party of three set out through the mountains across glaciers in 60-mile-per-hour winds. Six weeks and 320 miles out, one man fell into a crevasse, along with the tent, most of the equipment, all of the dogs' food, and all except a week's supply of the men's provisions.<br>Mawson's Will is the unforgettable story of one man's ingenious practicality and unbreakable spirit and how he continued his meticulous scientific observations even in the face of death. When the expedition was over, Mawson had added more territory to the Antarctic map than anyone else of his time.

Ostracized by the Jewish community in Amsterddam to which he was born, Spinoza developed a political philosophy that set out to justify the secular state ruled by a liberal constitution, and a metaphysics that sought to reconcile human freedom with a belief in scientific explanation. Here, Roger Scruton presents a clear and systematic analysis of Spinoza's thought and shows its relevance to today's intellectual preoccupations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Roger Scruton</strong> was Lecturer in Philosophy 1971-79, Reader 1979-85, and Professor of Aesthetics 1985-92 at Birkbeck College, University of London.<br>Once in a while, a publication comes along that on first sight seems oddly out of place but on second viewing is admirably suited to its purpose. This little series of biographical summaries of the thoughts of 24 Western philosophers from Democritus to Derrida is admirable not only for its reasonable price but even more for the intelligence and clarity of the writing. Each volume has been prepared by an expert in the subject, and the result is a series of well-drawn and exceptionally useful pocket-size (4.5 x 7 inches) sketches of major figures in the history of Western thought. The level is such that no special background in philosophy is required to understand the concepts discussed. Each volume also contains a short bibliography, some of which refer to electronic journals or web sites. Most of the individuals chosen for the series come as no surprise, e.g., Descartes, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Locke, Hume, Plato, and Socrates. But there are a few unexpected choices, like Alan Turing and Karl PopperAalthough on further consideration, they make more sense. Turing's influence on mathematics and on the development of computers has long been recognized, but his 1936 paper "On Compatible Numbers," which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1936-37, influenced studies in the philosophy of mind. Popper's development of the concept of "historicism" in such works as The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism significantly influenced 20th-century political thought. Ultimately, this set should be in every academic and public library as well as many school libraries.ATerry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

In <i>Everybody Was So Young</i> Amanda Vaill brilliantly portrays both the times in which the Murphys lived and the fascinating friends who flocked around them. Whether summering with Picasso on the French Riviera or watching bullfights with Hemingway in Pamplona, Gerald and Sara inspired kindred creative spirits like Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. &nbsp;Fitzgerald even modeled his main characters in <i>Tender is the Night</i> after the couple. Their story is both glittering and tragic, and in this sweeping and richly anecdotal portrait of a marriage and an era, Amanda Vaill "has brought them to life as never before" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).</p></p><p>Gerald and Sara Murphy were the golden couple of the Lost Generation. Born to wealth and privilege, they fled the stuffy confines of upper-class America to reinvent themselves in France as legendary party givers and enthusiastic participants in the modernist revolution of the 1920s. He became an important painter; she made everyday life a work of art. Their friends F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and John Dos Passos all based fictional characters on the Murphys; Picasso painted them; and Calvin Tomkins rekindled their glamour for a younger generation in his affectionate 1971 portrait, <i>Living Well Is the Best Revenge</i>. Amanda Vaill's vivid new biography builds on Tomkins's work to provide a full-length account of the Murphys' remarkable life together.<p> As well as good times, that life included suffering endured with great courage. The Murphys' teenage sons died within two years of each other in the mid-1930s--one suddenly, one after a long battle with tuberculosis--and the Depression forced Gerald to resume the uncongenial work of managing his family's business. Vaill's sensitive rendering reveals the moral substance that enabled this stylish couple to survive heartbreak. But it's her marvelous evocation of those magical expatriate years that lingers in the memory. The wit and imaginative panache with which the Murphys lived sparkles again, recapturing a splendid historical moment. As Sara later said, "It was like a great fair, and everybody was so young." <i>--Wendy Smith</i></p>Gifted artist Gerald Murphy and his elegant wife, Sara, were icons of the most enchanting period of our time; handsome, talented, and wealthy expatriate Americans, they were at the very center of the literary scene in Paris in the 1920s.

With a fondness for open space and anonymous thickets, he divides his time between Montana and southern Arizona.<br><br>Harrison (<i>Legends of the Fall</i>) has over decades won a durable following for verse and fiction about the wild places, solitudes and the exhilarations of the American West. This 12th book of verse gives familiar, quotable rural pleasures&#x2014;solitude, ease, forests and big skies&#x2014;along with a new focus on the poet's advancing years. I keep waiting without knowing/ what I'm waiting for, Harrison says in Age Sixty-Nine; in that waiting, he adds, on local earth my heart/ is at rest as a groundling. In low-pressure free verse, and in the prose poems that make up half the volume, Western American landscapes and beasts soar and roam off the page. (Mexican places and people, unfortunately, do not: they are leaden stereotypes.) People, for Harrison, are beasts as well, marine organisms at the bottom of the ocean/ of air. Paying homage to instinct, loyalty, memory and a companionable ferocity, Harrison finds his best subjects, often enough, in dogs. I know dog language fairly well, he explains, but then dogs hold a little back from us because we don't know their secret names given them by the dog gods. Barking brings the poet closer to the canine kingdom still: I was a dog on a short chain, he complains, and now there's no chain. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charles Perrow argues that the conventional engineering approach to ensuring safety--building in more warnings and safeguards--fails because systems complexity makes failures inevitable. He asserts that typical precautions, by adding to complexity, may help create new categories of accidents. (At Chernobyl, tests of a new safety system helped produce the meltdown and subsequent fire.) By recognizing two dimensions of risk--complex versus linear interactions, and tight versus loose coupling--this book provides a powerful framework for analyzing risks and the organizations that insist we run them.</p><br><p> The first edition fulfilled one reviewer's prediction that it "may mark the beginning of accident research." In the new afterword to this edition Perrow reviews the extensive work on the major accidents of the last fifteen years, including Bhopal, Chernobyl, and the Challenger disaster. The new postscript probes what the author considers to be the "quintessential 'Normal Accident'" of our time: the Y2K computer problem.</p></p><p>Hang a curtain too close to a fireplace and you run the risk of setting your house ablaze. Drive a car on a pitch-black night without headlights, and you dramatically increase the odds of smacking into a tree.<p> These are matters of common sense, applied to simple questions of cause and effect. But what happens, asks systems-behavior expert Charles Perrow, when common sense runs up against the complex systems, electrical and mechanical, with which we have surrounded ourselves? Plenty of mayhem can ensue, he replies. The Chernobyl nuclear accident, to name one recent disaster, was partially brought about by the failure of a safety system that was being brought on line, a failure that touched off an unforeseeable and irreversible chain of disruptions; the less severe but still frightening accident at Three Mile Island, similarly, came about as the result of small errors that, taken by themselves, were insignificant, but that snowballed to near-catastrophic result.</p><p> Only through such failures, Perrow suggests, can designers improve the safety of complex systems. But, he adds, those improvements may introduce new opportunities for disaster. Looking at an array of real and potential technological mishaps--including the Bhopal chemical-plant accident of 1984, the <i>Challenger</i> explosion of 1986, and the possible disruptions of Y2K and genetic engineering--Perrow concludes that as our technologies become more complex, the odds of tragic results increase. His treatise makes for sobering and provocative reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Charles Perrow</b> is Professor of Sociology at Yale University.

Economy provides an incisive look at the transformative changes underway in China today. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has unleashed a powerful set of political and economic reforms: the centralization of power under Xi, himself, the expansion of the Communist Party's role in Chinese political, social, and economic life, and the construction of a virtual wall of regulations to control more closely the exchange of ideas and capital between China and the outside world. Beyond its borders, Beijing has recast itself as a great power, seeking to reclaim its past glory and to create a system of international norms that better serves its more ambitious geostrategic objectives. In so doing, the Chinese leadership is reversing the trends toward greater political and economic opening, as well as the low-profile foreign policy, that had been put in motion by Deng Xiaoping's "Second Revolution" thirty years earlier. <br><br>Through a wide-ranging exploration of Xi Jinping's top political, economic and foreign policy priorities-fighting corruption, managing the Internet, reforming the state-owned enterprise sector, improving the country's innovation capacity, enhancing air quality, and elevating China's presence on the global stage-Economy identifies the tensions, shortcomings, and successes of Xi's reform efforts over the course of his first five years in office. She also assesses their implications for the rest of the world, and provides recommendations for how the United States and others should navigate their relationship with this vast nation in the coming years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elizabeth C.

The findings are both illuminating and disturbing." <br> -- David Shambaugh, George Washington University and author of <em>China Goes Global</em><p></p><br>"Americans are slowly realizing that they live in a bipolar world with China, a nation that is incontrovertibly rising despite the destabilizing effects of serial self-reinvention.

That's astonishing. And we still don't know what makes China's political leadership and Xi Jinping in particular tick. If that freaks you out (and it should), Liz Economy's book is the place to start." -- Ian Bremmer, President and Founder, Eurasia Group<p></p><br>"The timing of <em>The Third Revolution</em> is impeccable. Economy convincingly demonstrates how Beijing has used its heft to influence technological and political standards." - <em>The Financial Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"A work of cool-headed analysis." - <em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"The must-read book of 2018. . . .

All credit to the author, who emerges as the sort of<br>person who would be welcome at anyone`s dinner party."<br>--Mark Garnett, Lancaster University</p><h2>The Russian Debutante&#39;s Handbook</h2><p><b>A visionary novel from the author of <i>Super Sad True Love Story</i> and<i> Little Failure.</i></b><br><i><br>The&nbsp;Russian Debutante's Handbook </i>introduces Vladimir Girshkin, one of the most original and unlikely heroes of recent times. The twenty-five-year-old unhappy lover to a fat dungeon mistress, affectionately nicknamed "Little Failure" by his high-achieving mother, Vladimir toils his days away as a lowly clerk at the bureaucratic Emma Lazarus Immigrant Absorption Society. When a wealthy but psychotic old Russian war hero appears, Vladimir embarks on an adventure of unrelenting lunacy that takes us from New York's Lower East Side to the hip frontier wilderness of Prava--the Eastern European Paris of the nineties. With the help of a murderous but fun-loving Russian mafioso, Vladimir infiltrates the Prava expat community and launches a scheme as ridiculous as it is brilliant.<br><br>Bursting with wit, humor, and rare insight, <i>The Russian Debutante's Handbook </i>is both a highly imaginative romp and a serious exploration of what it means to be an immigrant in America.</p><p>Vladimir Girshkin, a likeable Russian immigrant, searches for love, a decent job, and a credible self-identity in Gary Shteyngart's debut novel, <i>The Russian Debutante's Handbook</i>. With a doctor-father of questionable ethics and a manic, banker mother, Vladimir avoids his suburban parents and their desire that he pursue the almighty dollar as proof of success. Vladimir gets by as an immigration clerk, eking out a living in a cruddy New York City apartment while accumulating an array of quirky acquaintances, from a wealthy but disheveled old man (who claims his electric fan speaks to him) desperate for citizenship to Challa, a portly S/M queen. As a love interest, Challa is replaced by Francesca, a graduate student whose friends welcome Vladimir for the status he brings their bohemian clique, and whose parents encourage them to shack up (she lives at home) as visible proof she can maintain a steady relationship.<p> <i>The Russian Debutante's Handbook</i> is a quirky amalgam of dead-on American absurdities, albeit with somewhat stereotypical characters. While Vladimir flounders with how to improve his state, he becomes an expatriate in a trendy European city, becomes somewhat of a mobster himself, and generally has a good time. While many of the central characters remain elusively thin, Vladimir is a delight, and Shteyngart's wit is merciless: Russian women wear "wedding cakes of blond hair" and graduate students lounge in a bar "as if waiting for funding to appear." Reminiscent of Gogol and other Russian satirists, <i>The Russian Debutante's Handbook</i> is a genuine, sublime social commentary. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><b>Gary Shteyngart</b> is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the memoir <i>Little Failure </i>(a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist) and the novels <i>Super Sad True Love Story</i> (winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize),<i> Absurdistan, </i>and <i>The Russian Debutante&#x2019;s Handbook</i> (winner of the Stephen Crane Award for First Fiction and the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction)<i>. </i>His books regularly appear on best-of lists around the world and have been published in thirty countries.</p><h2>Elementary Number Theory: Second Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>Ideal for a first course in number theory, this lively, engaging text requires only a familiarity with elementary algebra and the properties of real numbers. Author Underwood Dudley, who has written a series of popular mathematics books, maintains that the best way to learn mathematics is by solving problems. In keeping with this philosophy, the text includes nearly 1,000 exercises and problems&#x2014;some computational and some classical, many original, and some with complete solutions. <br>The opening chapters offer sound explanations of the basics of elementary number theory and&nbsp;develop the fundamental properties of integers and congruences. Subsequent chapters present proofs of Fermat's and Wilson's theorems, introduce number theoretic functions, and explore the quadratic reciprocity theorem. Three independent sections follow, with examinations of the representation of numbers, diophantine equations, and primes. The text concludes with 260 additional problems, three helpful appendixes, and answers to selected exercises and problems.</p><p>Underwood Dudley is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at DePauw University. <p><b>Underwood Dudley: Cranking Out Classics <br></b>Any editor involved with publishing in mathematics for any length of time is familiar with the phenomena &#x2014; the receipt, usually via snail mail, of generally handwritten, and generally interminable, really, really interminable, theses on some bizarre and unprovable point &#x2014; theses hoping, trying against all hope, demanding in fact, to prove the unprovable, to rewrite some fundamental part of mathematics, often in my experience to demonstrate for one final time that, for example, Einstein didn't know what he was talking about &#x2014; in short, the work of a mathematical crank! </p><p> </p><p>Underwood Dudley (Woody to everyone in the math world), Professor Emeritus, Depauw University, provided an inestimable service to all math editors in the universe by demonstrating that they are not alone in their experience. His unique and wonderful book <i>Mathematical Cranks</i> (The Mathematics Association of America, 1992) is a readable feast, especially for those who have been on the receiving end of mathematical crank mail. We're all in Woody's debt for having assembled this collection of failed squared circles, angle trisections, and much, much more. </p><p> </p><p>However, chronicling the cranks &#x2014; as enjoyable as it may have been to the rest of us &#x2014; is hardly a career, Woody has written many other books as well.

As morale at Telgar Weyr plunges in the wake of the widespread loss, and Weyrwoman Fiona and the harper Kindan struggle to keep hope from vanishing, a pregnant Lorana decides she must take drastic steps. Nothing short of manipulating time itself will undo the damage done by the plague. But attempting time travel could have devastating consequences&#x2014;altering history, and destiny, forever. Now, somehow, Lorana must find a way to accomplish what seems impossible: bending the natural laws of the universe without wreaking havoc on existence itself. To ensure the future of Pern, she&#x2019;s willing to take the fateful chance&#x2014;even if it demands yet another, far greater, sacrifice.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne McCaffrey, </b>the Hugo Award&#x2013;winning author of the bestselling Dragonriders of Pern� novels, is one of science fiction&#x2019;s most popular authors.

A dragon gold is only the first price you&#x2019;ll pay for Pern.<br><br>Cold. Black. Silent.<br><br>Deadly.<br><br>Between. That strange nothingness where dragons can go that can only be described as &#x201c;between one place and another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Between only lasts as long as it takes to cough three times.&#x201d; For a short journey, yes. For a journey from one place to another, anywhere on Pern--yes, three coughs is enough. But when traveling between one time and another--it takes longer. A cold, silent, freezing longer that saps life.<br><br>Lorana felt nothing, not the warmth of the queen dragon beneath her, not even the tiny, tender presence that warmed her womb.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sorry! Lorana cried, her hand going to her belly. There was no other way!<br><br>No response.<br><br>Pern was dying, there were too few dragons and riders to protect it from Thread. Slowly, steadily, inexorably, the protection of Pern was being eroded, was dying out. The dragonriders, including Weyrleader T&#x2019;mar, Weyrwoman Fiona, and all the Weyrleaders of the four other Weyrs, had tried their best, had developed new tactics, had kept adapting, kept striving, kept searching for some way out of their trap. But the problem was that there were too few dragons, less than a third the number required, and more were being lost each Fall.<br><br>The dragons&#x2019; numbers were so few because of the strange sickness that had come upon them just before the start of this new Pass of the Red Star. Lorana, with Kindan&#x2019;s stout aid, had succeeded in finding help from the distant past and that help had led them to a cure for the sickness. In the meantime, however, too many dragons had succumbed to the sickness--and more to Thread--leaving too few dragons to protect the planet. In desperation, because no one could conceive of getting further help from the past, Lorana had decided to jump forward in time, to jump ahead to a time after the Third Pass and beg for aid from the future.<br><br>She was the only one with a sure sense of time and place--a gift, she thought, from her special link with all the dragons of Pern--and only she could make the journey forward to such an unknown, unseen time. She used the Red Star to guide her, picturing it and the stars in their stations where they would be fifty Turns from her present.<br><br>Using her gift came at a price, however. A jump of this length would be a terrible strain on her and gold Minith. But it would be fatal to the life stirring inside her.<br><br>Lorana wailed silently. Go back! she urged herself. Go back before it&#x2019;s too late.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t, she decided a moment later. It&#x2019;s too late. I&#x2019;m all alone.<br><br>I&#x2019;m here! Minith called to her feebly, her touch full of support. You are not alone.<br><br>Lorana made no reply. She knew she couldn&#x2019;t explain herself to the gold dragon, to a queen who laid eggs.<br><br>Everything I&#x2019;ve loved, I&#x2019;ve lost, Lorana thought to herself, letting her hand slip, unfelt, unfeeling, from her belly.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve lost my own queen, my beloved fire-lizards, and now . . . She couldn&#x2019;t finish the thought.<br><br>Tears froze on her cheeks, her heart beat at a slow, glacial pace, as the cold of between sapped her strength, her life.<br><br>And stilled the life of the other inside her.<br><br>A dragon gold is only the first price . . .<br><br>The cold between gripped her and she knew no more.<br>Lorana closed her eyes in a spasm of pain. She was in a bed, in a nightgown. Fearful, her hands went to her belly--it was flat, lifeless.<br><br>&#x201c;You lost the baby,&#x201d; a voice said. It was old, hoarse with age, but somehow familiar. &#x201c;But you knew that. You planned on it.&#x201d;<br><br>Tullea. Benden&#x2019;s Weyrwoman, Minith&#x2019;s rightful rider.<br><br>Minith? Lorana called.<br><br>I am here, the queen responded quickly. There was no echo to her voice: no sign that an older Minith--a Minith of this future time--had heard her call.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Tullea warned harshly. &#x201c;You are still too weak. I wasn&#x2019;t sure that you wanted to live yourself.&#x201d; She paused for a moment, then added, &#x201c;Perhaps you didn&#x2019;t, really.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where am I? Is the Pass over?&#x201d; Lorana asked, her eyes still closed. Her mouth was dry; her voice was slurred and felt awkward.<br><br>&#x201c;The Pass is over,&#x201d; Tullea affirmed. &#x201c;That much I&#x2019;ll tell you and no more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Help?&#x201d; Lorana said. She realized that word wasn&#x2019;t enough and, after another breath, asked, &#x201c;Will you send help?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dragons from the future?&#x201d; Tullea said. &#x201c;Simple, quick, efficient! Oh, yes, no worries for those left behind.&#x201d; She snorted and added viciously, &#x201c;Oh, no! No, dragon-stealer, you won&#x2019;t find any dragons in the future.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None?&#x201d; Lorana opened her eyes only to find the room completely dark.<br><br>&#x201c;None for you,&#x201d; Tullea snapped back. &#x201c;You were always meddling when you should have left things alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s B&#x2019;nik?&#x201d; Lorana asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s his jacket?&#x201d; Tullea retorted. She barked a bitter laugh. &#x201c;Between, that&#x2019;s where! Where you left it!&#x201d;<br><br>Lorana wondered for a moment if the old queen rider had gone insane.<br><br>&#x201c;Where you must go, now!&#x201d; Tullea went on, and Lorana gasped as, abruptly, the blankets were pulled off her. &#x201c;Get up, your things are over there!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But--I want to talk--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve talked enough!&#x201d; Tullea snapped, grabbing Lorana&#x2019;s hand and feebly pulling on it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re well enough to travel; it&#x2019;s time--long time--you were gone.&#x201d; Tullea seemed to think her last comment funny and let out another bitter laugh.<br><br>The faintest of glows, smaller than any Lorana had ever seen, was turned. It provided only a dim light, which revealed bare stone walls, the rude blanket thrown over her, and the rough, reed bed beneath her. And Tullea--old, bent, white-haired, almost unrecognizable.<br><br>&#x201c;Take my dragon with you, dragon-stealer!&#x201d; Tullea said, throwing clothes toward her.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I talk to anyone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What makes you think there&#x2019;s anyone to talk to?&#x201d; Tullea asked sharply.<br><br>Lorana started to answer, then stretched her senses, searching for someone, for a dragon or even a watch-wher, but--<br><br>Slap! Her cheek was suddenly aflame with stinging pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that!&#x201d; Tullea barked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me remember!&#x201d; She shoved Lorana. &#x201c;Get dressed, get going! Now!&#x201d;<br><br>Shocked and depressed, Lorana wordlessly slipped back into her riding clothes. Her undergarments were unwashed; they smelled of sweat and the fear she&#x2019;d felt when she&#x2019;d made this journey to the future.<br><br>So far. She&#x2019;d come so far. She&#x2019;d given so much.<br><br>&#x201c;Get moving!&#x201d; Tullea hustled her along. &#x201c;Time enough to think later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please, we need help,&#x201d; Lorana said even as Tullea nudged her. They walked down a slope on a cloudy, starless night. She heard more then saw Minith in the distance.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to fly high and south to get above the clouds and see the Red Star,&#x201d; Tullea told her as she tried to push Lorana up onto the gold dragon. &#x201c;Be quick about it! I want to have as much time with my dragon as I can!&#x201d;<br><br>Lorana found herself perched on Minith, wondering if the poor gold queen had been wearing the riding harness the whole time Lorana had been a babbling wreck in bed. Had she even been fed?<br><br>&#x201c;Of course she was fed!&#x201d; Tullea declared irritably. &#x201c;Now, go! Go back where you belong!&#x201d; She barked another dry laugh. &#x201c;The Red Star will guide you, just as it did when you came here!&#x201d;<br><br>Without another word, Tullea turned away, heading back up toward the cave from which they&#x2019;d emerged. Lorana watched her in the dim light, frowning. Wasn&#x2019;t there anything she could do?<br><br>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Tullea wailed.<br><br>Come on, Minith, let&#x2019;s go, Lorana said sadly to the queen. In a moment they were airborne, climbing toward the clouds. As they rose higher, the clouds thinned and she could see the Red Star faintly through the breaks.<br><br>She brought the image of Red Butte into her mind with stars, moons, and the Red Star to mark the time, thankful for the very small favor of Tullea&#x2019;s, and gave Minith the coordinates.<br><br>All this way, she thought to herself as they entered the cold of between. Involuntarily her hands went to her belly. Her cold, flat, lifeless belly. All for nothing!<br>Tullea turned back when she heard the sound of Minith going between. Her shoulders slumped and she let out a deep, regretful sigh.<br><br>Minith, tell her it&#x2019;s done, Tullea thought, stretching her mind into between in the special way she&#x2019;d been taught.<br><br>A moment later the air was full of the sound of dragon wings. A pale yellow specter, a ghost of the young fertile queen who&#x2019;d been here just moments before, landed daintily in front of her with the grace of long years.<br><br>Beside her, another queen landed. And another.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay there!&#x201d; Tullea called up to the two queen riders. &#x201c;I want to get back to the Weyr and feel some warmth in my bones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did she take it?&#x201d; the older of the two riders asked, her face bleak with sorrow.<br><br>&#x201c;Just like you said she would,&#x201d; Tullea snapped waspishly. For a moment her habitual mask slipped and she asked, &#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t I have told her? Why did I have to be a monster to her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s what she said,&#x201d; the woman replied. Her hair was mostly white with only a few streaks of blond left in it, but her eyes were still the sea green blue they&#x2019;d always been. &#x201c;She said that you were horrible to her, gave her not one moment&#x2019;s kindness.&#x201d; She paused and added, &#x201c;Nor one clue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;ll never know,&#x201d; Tullea mused to herself. &#x201c;She never found out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Fiona replied sadly. &#x201c;She never had a chance to learn how you&#x2019;d changed.&#x201d; She smiled at the older woman. &#x201c;But I did.&#x201d;<br><br>Tullea snorted in disbelief.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you think I insisted on that glow?&#x201d; Fiona asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Because Lorana said that&#x2019;s what there was,&#x201d; Tullea said.<br><br>&#x201c;Because if there&#x2019;d been more light, she would have seen your face clearly,&#x201d; Fiona told her.<br><br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Tullea barked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s old, it&#x2019;s creased.&#x201d; Her tone changed as the feeble spark of anger in her dimmed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lived a long life; I&#x2019;m ready for my rest. We go back to the Weyr, I say my farewells, and you keep your part of the bargain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Fiona agreed.<br><br>Tullea mounted, moving slowly with care for her old bones even as she cursed her age. It was time, she thought to herself. She&#x2019;d seen enough, lived enough. It was time.<br><br>Before she urged Minith back to the Weyr, she turned to Fiona. &#x201c;What about the light?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The lines in your face,&#x201d; Fiona said by way of explanation. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not lines of sorrow. If she&#x2019;d seen them, she&#x2019;d have known.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Tullea replied. Her face grew brighter and she shot the younger woman a smile as she added more emphatically, &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d;<br><br>It was only when they were back in the Weyr, when Fiona was helping Tullea down off the aged Minith, that the older Weyrwoman had time again to think of what she&#x2019;d done.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you ever tell her?&#x201d; she asked without hope.<br><br>&#x201c;About you?&#x201d; Fiona asked sadly. At the old woman&#x2019;s nod, she shook her head. &#x201c;No, I never knew. Never knew until it was too late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pity,&#x201d; Tullea said. She glanced toward the clouds and the night sky, which threatened rain later. &#x201c;I would have liked for her to know.&#x201d; She snorted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the least I could do, for all that she&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;<br><br>Above them, the sky was torn open as wing after wing of dragons appeared overhead and spiraled down gracefully into the Weyr below.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell him at least,&#x201d; Tullea pleaded as she glanced upward at the returning dragons, with Benden&#x2019;s Weyrleader in the vanguard.<br><br>&#x201c;That his mother was here tonight?&#x201d; Fiona asked, looking over toward the Benden Weyrleader. &#x201c;Or how surprised she&#x2019;d be to know that he&#x2019;s partnered with your daughter?&#x201d;<br><br>A streak of light burst from the Dining Cavern and a young form raced into sight, stopping with sudden concern for Tullea&#x2019;s old bones.<br><br>The dark-haired little boy looked up at Tullea and she knelt down.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old to pick you up, you know,&#x201d; she said as she drew him into a great hug. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll miss you most of all.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy looked at her in confusion, his dark brown eyes were deep and thoughtful, slanted just slightly and shrouded by the thick dark hair that made him the near-twin of his great-grandmother.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d be proud, you know,&#x201d; Fiona spoke up quietly from Tullea&#x2019;s side, with a brief tilt of her head toward Benden&#x2019;s Weyrleader.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to be proud enough for all of them,&#x201d; Tullea replied, her eyes spangled with tears.<br>Again Lorana was numb, voiceless, shocked by the length of the cold between. She had followed Tullea&#x2019;s image blindly, and so it came as a shock to realize that she and Minith seemed to be between for even longer than on their jump forward. Where was Tullea sending her?<br><br>Suddenly, as if in a clear instant, Lorana froze, thinking that she heard voices. She strained her senses, reached out, and caught--panic, fear, despair!<br><br>A man&#x2019;s voice cried out. And a woman&#x2019;s, too. Fiona?<br><br>Lorana started to worry that she had jumped blindly between forever, like D&#x2019;gan and the Telgar riders, and that perhaps she was hearing Fiona&#x2019;s voice calling for her. She tried to reach out, to touch Fiona, to find her and then--<br>She burst forth into a cold night sky. It felt as cold as between, and as dark--except she could see a spattering of stars in the sky and a small light below.<br><br>She realized suddenly where she was--she had drawn a picture of it once long ago--Red Butte, the massive uprising of rock in the center of the Keroon Plains. Minith, without urging, began a slow, steady spiral down toward the light.<br><br>It was a campfire, warm and inviting. Lorana saw one figure rise from beside it before exhaustion overtook her once more and even that small light went dark.<br>&#x201c;The soup is warm, you should sip it slowly,&#x201d; a young man&#x2019;s voice said. A hand covered her eyes briefly as he added quickly, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t open your eyes until you&#x2019;ve sat up, or you&#x2019;ll stare straight into the sun!&#x201d;<br><br>Lorana was lying on the ground, its rock-hardness eased by a layer of soft cushions, perhaps a pile of reeds. She sat up slowly and opened her eyes.<br><br>An earnest young man smiled at her, proffering a steaming bowl of soup.<br><br>Thirsty, cold, and fatigued, Lorana took the bowl and drank a quick, small sip.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good!&#x201d; she said, taking a longer drink.<br><br>&#x201c;Finish it, I&#x2019;ll get more,&#x201d; the young man offered, pointing at a large cauldron resting on the side of a neat ring of rocks.<br><br>Lorana gladly complied. At the man&#x2019;s gesture, she handed him the bowl and he scooted over to the cauldron to dip out another serving. He coughed once and shook his head with a frown.</p><h2>Stella by Starlight</h2><p>When the Ku Klux Klan&#x2019;s unwelcome reappearance rattles Stella&#x2019;s segregated southern town, bravery battles prejudice in this Depression-era tour de force from Sharon Draper, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Out of My Mind</i>.<br><br>Stella lives in the segregated South&#x2014;in Bumblebee, North Carolina, to be exact about it.

Against the black of night, a single wooden cross blazed. Reflections of peppery-red flames shimmered across the otherwise dark surface of Kilkenny Pond.<br> <br>Two children, crouched behind the low-hanging branches of a hulking oak tree on the other side of the pond, watched the flickers of scarlet in the distance in fearful silence. Dressed only in nightshirts, Stella Mills and her brother Jojo shivered in the midnight October chill.<br> <br>Stella yanked the boy close, dry leaves crunching beneath his bare feet. &#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; she whispered, holding him tightly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jojo squirmed out of her grasp. &#x201c;It was me that saw &#x2019;em first!&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d still be &#x2019;sleep if I hadn&#x2019;t come and got you. So lemme see!&#x201d;<br> <br>Stella covered her brother&#x2019;s lips with her fingers to quiet him. Even though her toes were numb with cold and she knew they needed to get out of there, she could not take her eyes from the horror glimmering toward them from across the pond. &#x201c;Do you know what would happen if they saw us?&#x201d; she whispered, shifting her stinging feet, the crushing of dry leaves seeming far too loud.<br> <br>Jojo pressed himself closer to her in answer.<br> <br>Besides the traitorous leaves, Stella could hear a pair of bullfrogs ba-rupping to each other, but nothing, not a single human voice, from across the pond. She could, however, smell the charring pine, tinged with . . . what? She sniffed deeper&#x2014;it was acrid, harsh. Kerosene. A trail of gray smoke snaked up to the sky, merging with the clouds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Jojo whispered, stealing another glance.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Klan.&#x201d; Just saying those words made Stella&#x2019;s lips quiver.<br> <br>The Ku Klux Klan.<br> <br>Here.<br> <br>Here!<br> <br>&#x201c;What are they doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Practicing, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Stella paused and smoothed his bushy hair, trying to figure out the best way to answer. Jojo was only eight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing good,&#x201d; she said at last.<br> <br>A horse whinnied in the distance&#x2014;it sounded nervous. And there, in the shadows of the trees across the pond, Stella could make out half a dozen of them. The flames must be scaring them, too, she thought. The horses began to stamp and snort as the fire flared.<br> <br>Stella inched forward, trying to get a better look. One of the harnesses seemed to sparkle in the darkness. Or was it just a stray ember from the flames? The men in the white hoods were now all raising their arms to the sky, and they cried out as one, but their exact words were muffled by cloth and wind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jojo, we&#x2019;ve gotta get out of here!&#x201d; she whispered, now edging backward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should we tell Mama and Papa?&#x201d; Jojo asked.<br> <br>Stella did not answer her brother. Instead she caught his hand in her tightest grip and ran.</p><h2>A Duke by Any Other Name</h2><p><b>With her trademark wit, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Grace Burrowes delivers a charming Regency romance featuring a duke in disguise and a hellion trying to convince Society she's a lady. </b><br>Nathaniel, Duke of Rothhaven, lives in seclusion, leaving his property only to gallop his demon-black steed across the moors by moonlight. Exasperated mamas invoke his name to frighten small children, though Nathaniel is truly a decent man -- maybe too decent for his own good. That's precisely why he must turn away the beguiling woman demanding his help. <br><br>Lady Althea Wentworth has little patience for dukes, reclusive or otherwise, but she needs Rothhaven's backing to gain entrance into Polite Society. She's asked him nicely, she's called on him politely, all to no avail -- until her prize hogs <i>just happen</i> to plunder the ducal orchard. He longs for privacy.

Vogt continues the tradition of excellence established by previous volumes. Divided into three parts, Interpreting the Pentateuch first provides an overview of the major themes of the Pentateuch. In the second part, Vogt offers resources and strategies for interpreting and understanding the first five books of the Bible by exploring its genres-law and narrative. Finally, Vogt shows that, although the Pentateuch is a collection of ancient texts, it still has contemporary significance. Vogt also includes two samples-one from law and one from narrative-of exegesis, giving students a start-to-finish example of the techniques he has illustrated for effective exegesis.</p><p><b>Peter T.

Wingate Todd of Western Reserve University School of Medicine. This intensive study collected data on the maturation of human anatomy through the meticulous X-raying of a series of research subjects enrolled in the study as juveniles&#x2015;some as young as three months&#x2015;and thereafter routinely weighed and measured at three-month to one-year intervals, depending on their age. This <i>Atlas</i> utilizes not only the X-ray films to which Todd had access but, also, those which were obtained in the six years subsequent to Todd's publication of his <i>Atlas of Skeletal Maturation of the Hand</i>. The X-ray standards in the present volume are, therefore, the first to be based exclusively on the research of the Brush Foundation Study.</p><p>&#x201c;Here is a book which compiles the most accurate data on bone age in an extremely useful form, so that the practicing clinician, pediatrician, general practitioner, internist, or radiologist may find data quickly and accurately. . . . This book represents a tremendous amount of work, a study of over 1,000 individuals, with from two to twenty films each, in an effort to find an acceptable series of standards. . . . This book should be in te possession of all those who expect to interpret skeletal age from films or assess the patient from that clinical point of view.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stanford Medical Bulletin<br>&#x201c;To pediatrician, radiologist and all those responsible for the physical care of the child, this Atlas is essential.

She ran away from her family twenty years ago after a shocking event left her devastated and distrustful of those she loved: her mother, the woman who raised her and who Molly says is dead but is very much alive; her birth mother, whose mysterious presence raised so many issues; and the father she adored, whose troubling death sent her running from the small community of Morrison Ridge.</p><p>Now, as she tries to find a way to make peace with her past and embrace a future filled with promise, she discovers that even she doesn't know the truth of what happened in her family of pretenders.</p><p>Told with Diane Chamberlain&#x2019;s compelling prose and gift for deft exploration of the human heart, <i>Pretending to Dance</i> is an exploration of family, lies, and the complexities of both.</p></p><p>DIANE CHAMBERLAIN is the international bestselling author of more than twenty novels, including <i>The First Lie, Her Mother's Shadow, </i>and <i>The Good Father</i>. She lives in North Carolina with her partner, photographer John Pagliuca, and her shelties, Keeper and Cole.Molly and her husband, Aidan, want to adopt a baby. A young pregnant girl who wants to give her child up thinks that they may be the couple to become her baby's parents. But though Molly knows that she wants this baby, she is also unsure about being an adoptive mother. Her past looms close and hides a secret that she fears will unhinge not only this adoption but possibly her marriage. Alternating chapters tell the story of Molly's life during the summer she turned 14 in her small North Carolina town, juxtaposed with chapters about her life today as a lawyer in San Diego. She was raised in a loving family with a pharmacist mother and a therapist father with multiple sclerosis. That summer, Molly befriends a new girl who introduces her to an older boy, and subsequently drugs and sex. When a devastating event occurs and her beloved father dies, Molly is unable to reconcile the actions of her family. She is unable to trust them and leaves them behind, first for boarding schools and then for her adult life in San Diego. It is only her fear that the past is beginning to influence her present that pushes her to deal with those earlier events.

Despite its title, it's not wild ranting pseudo-science to be dismissed by those with brains. Rather, Amdahl maintains that one need not understand quantum physics to grasp how electricity works in practical applications. To understand your toaster or your fax machine, it doesn't really matter whether there are electrons or not, and it's a lot easier and more fun to start with the toaster than with quarks and calculus. The book is mildly weird, often funny, always clear and easy to understand. It assumes the reader doesn't know a volt from a hole in the ground and gently leads him or her through integrated circuits, radio, oscillators and the basics of the digital revolution using examples that include green buffalo, microscopic beer parties, break-dancing chickens and naked Norwegian girls in rowboats. OK, it's more than mildly weird. <p>The book has been reprinted numerous times since 1991 and has achieved minor cult status. Reviewed and praised in dozens of electronics and educational magazines, it is used as a text by major corporations, colleges, high schools, military schools and trade schools. It has been studied by education programs at colleges across the United States. This book was making wise cracks in the corner before anyone thought of designing books for dummies and idiots; some say it helped to inspire that industry. </p><p>It may be the only "introduction to electronics books" with back cover comments by Dave Barry, Ray Bradbury, Clive Cussler, and George Garrett, as well as recomendations from Robert Hazen, Bob Mostafapour, Dr. Roger Young, Dr. Wayne Green, Scott Rundle, Brian Battles, Michelle Guido, Herb Reichert and Emil Venere. As Monitoring Times said, "Perhaps the best electronics book ever. If you'd like to learn about basic electronics but haven't been able to pull it off, get There Are No Electrons. Just trust us. Get the book."</p></p><p>"There Are No Electrons changed my life. I lost 17 pounds in five minutes without dieting, and I feel great!" Dave Barry <p>"Fascinating and fun! We all feel somewhat dumb when it comes to electronics. There Are No Electrons would be a proper tonic for this ignorance" Ray Bradbury </p><p>"I think There Are No Electrons is a major breakthrough in teaching the elementary physics of electricity. It should be required basic reading for high school science students. </p><p>"After 58 years of wandering in an electronic void, even a blockhead like me, who could never visualize the abstract, was able to penetrate the nebulous mists of amps, volts, current, induction, and conductors, and actually understand what the hell they're all about. </p><p>"Who knows? Perhaps it will lead to a whole new concept of teaching." Clive Cussler </p><p>"I am sure that Kenn Amdahl's lively and entertaining book will be a whole lot of help to people who are seriously engaged in learning about electronics. And that is an important achievement. But, above and beyond the practical, Amdahl, with a magical energy all his own, has created a wonderful book about 'a beautiful and powerful mystery.' This book is about electricity and everything else, too. I can't wait to recommend it to all my friends."

He lives in Seattle, Washington.</p>*Starred Review* This guy really likes to write long books. <i>Cyptonomicon</i>, his 1999 epic, was roughly the same length as the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. <i>Quicksilver</i> (2003), the first volume of his Baroque Cycle, was well over 900 pages, and this second installment is in the same ballpark. It picks up the story in 1689. Jack Shaftoe, self-proclaimed king of the vagabonds, is a galley slave, but that's soon going to change: he and nine of his fellow slaves engineer an escape. Their plan, to steal a cache of Spanish silver, turns out better (and also worse) than they could have imagined. Meanwhile, Eliza, a notorious spy whom Jack once rescued from a Turkish harem, is trying to get to London with her newborn baby. Set during one of history's most exciting times, from 1600 to 1750, this series brilliantly captures the intellectual excitement and cultural revolution of the era. With real-life supporting characters such as Isaac Newton and Wilhelm Leibnitz, the series blends fact and fiction so cleverly that it is virtually impossible to separate one from the other. Stephenson is a graceful writer, never getting bogged down in detail, keeping the story moving, dazzling us with his technique. The concluding volume of the trilogy is scheduled to appear in October 2004, and it's fair to say anyone who reads this one will spend the intervening months waiting with breathless anticipation. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Michael Tellinger has come full circle since his epic &#x201c;Slave Species of god&#x201d; in 2006, by proposing a blueprint for the emancipation of the slave species called humanity. Tellinger exposes the previously misunderstood origins of money and the rise of the royal banking elite that have controlled the world for millennia and continue to do so today through the modern banking families. He points out that money did not evolve from thousands of years of barter and trade, but that it was maliciously introduced to the human race as a tool of absolute control and enslavement. Tellinger makes a strong case that if we do not understand our human origins, we cannot come to terms with why the world is so messed up in the 21st century. He demonstrates that our current situation presents us with a unique opportunity to change the course of our destiny. Michael Tellinger describes how the ancient African philosophy of UBUNTU will allow us to seamlessly move from a divided, money-driven society, to united communities driven by people, their passion for life and their God-given talents. Coming to terms with our enslavement as a species is critical to discovering the path to full enlightenment. UBUNTU Contributionism presents a solid foundation for a new social structure to take us into a new era of true freedom from financial tyranny and real prosperity on every level of human endeavour.</p><p>Michael Tellinger is a scientist, explorer and internationally acclaimed author of numerous books, who has become an authority on the vanished civilisations of southern Africa and the origins of humankind. His discoveries of an advanced vanished civilisation in South Africa includes a diverse field of research and touches on human origins, spirituality, science, and consciousness. He has shown that long before the Egyptians saw the light of day, an advanced civilisation of humans lived in southern Africa, mining gold. They carved the first Horus bird, the first Sphinx, built the first pyramids and built an accurate stone calendar right in the heart of it all. Adam&#x2019;s Calendar is the flagship among millions of circular stone ruins, ancient channels, agricultural terraces and thousands of ancient mines left behind by a vanished civilisation unknown to us before, which we now call the FIRST PEOPLE. Michael has revealed evidence that these people had an astute knowledge of the laws of nature and the generation of FREE ENERGY using the power of sound from the Earth as a source of this energy. His discoveries have resulted in his close involvement with the Global Breakthrough Energy Movement, and his research has caught the attention of many scientist and inventors around the world. Michael&#x2019;s work touches critical issues around the subject of Unity Consciousness. He believes that quantum physics is a gift from the divine creator to allow humanity to find its way back to source &#x2013; back to unity &#x2013; from a deeply divided and manipulated species. Tellinger claims that only by understanding our mysterious past, the origins of money and the rise of the royal bloodlines, can we make sense of the insane world we live in today. It was his intimate understanding of our ancient past that allowed him to postulate a whole new way forward for humanity &#x2013; something that has never been done before. A model for a new social structure which he called CONTRIBUTIONISM. Michael Tellinger is the founder of the UBUNTU LIBERATION MOVEMENT and the UBUNTU political party in South Africa &#x2013; which will be contesting the national elections in SA during 2014.

It was high in protein, with balanced fats, and usually included a few fruits, vegetables and grasses. Steve Brown, an expert on canine nutrition, shows how you can bring the benefits of the canine ancestral diet to your dog by feeding him differently as little as just one day a week. And no, you won&#x2019;t need to lead a pack of dogs on a hunting expedition! Just follow Steve&#x2019;s well-researched and easy to follow ABCs to make improvements to whatever your dog currently eats. BONUS! Raw food or home prepared feeders will learn how to balance nutrients more precisely, especially fats, for optimum health.A dog diet to get wild about!-Learn about the latest research on the importance of protein and healthy fats in your dog&#x2019;s diet.-Find out why commercial foods can&#x2019;t include these fragile-but-crucial nutrients, and how you can make sure your dog gets them.-Just one day a week, or more frequently if you choose, follow the simple recipes that balance the nutrition in the commercial food you are feeding&#x2014;wet or dry!</p><p>Steve Brown turned his passion for canine health into developing leading-edge products and educational programs to improve canine nutrition. He developed Charlee Bear Dog Treats�, one of the best selling dog treats in the US and, in 1998, he developed Steve&#x2019;s Real Food� for Pets, the first AAFCO-compliant, frozen, raw meat-based diet. Brown is the co-author of See Spot Live Longer and has written numerous articles on canine nutrition published in leading pet health and veterinary journals. Steve lives outside of Eugene, Oregon.Brown has done his homework and is able to present his case for feeding a nutrient mix that more closely matches what has been health food for hundred of generations of canines. <i>Unlocking the Canine Ancestral Diet</i> is chock full of information that supports his premise that the ancestral diet is good stuff for today's dogs. It's a good read, packed with scientifically-backed information, and it presents a practical approach for achieving the goal of helping us to make a healthy diet for our dogs. As easy as ABC. --Randy Kidd, author of <i>Dr. Kidd's Guide to Herbal Dog Care</i><br><br>I find this book to be enlightening and invaluable. I especially like the fact that his guidelines can help balance canine diets no matter what the caregiver's level of commitment is to the ancestral diet. Dry food feeders can greatly enhance their pet's nutrition with just one homemade meal a week. Raw fed dogs can benefit from a balancing meal as well. --Doug Knueven, DVM, CVA, CAC<br><br>To prevent chronic disease in dogs you must get a critical balance of species appropriate foods and fats in your companion's diet. Steve Brown understands this and you can too by reading his book. --Karen Becker, DVM</p><h2>Our Pioneers and Patriots</h2><p>Famous 5th-8th grade Catholic American History text with Study Questions &amp; Activities.

Presented in an arrestingly original format--individual chapbooks that can be read in any order, and that float inside a transparent case--this collection conjures a mix of voices, time periods, and structures to explore what makes people, memories, and stories "maddeningly attractive" when observed in spaces that are suggestively in-between. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>One can begin with Carson contemplating Proust on a frozen Icelandic plain, or on the art-saturated streets of downtown New York City. Or journey to the peak of Mount Olympus, where Zeus ponders his own afterlife. Or find a chorus of Gertrude Steins performing an essay about falling--a piece that also unearths poignant memories of Carson's own father and great-uncle in rural Canada. And a poem called "Wildly Constant" piercingly explores the highs and lows of marriage and monogamy, distilled in a wife's waking up her husband from the darkness of night, and asking him to make them eggs for breakfast. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Exquisite, heartbreaking, disarmingly funny, <i>Float</i> kaleidoscopically illuminates the uncanny magic that comes with letting go of expectations and boundaries. It is Carson's most intellectually electrifying, emotionally engaging book to date.</p><p><b>ANNE CARSON</b> was born in Canada and has been a professor of Classics for over thirty years. Her awards and honors include the Lannan Award, the Pushcart Prize, the Griffin Trust Award for Excellence in Poetry, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur Foundations.&#x201c;Carson&#x2019;s 22 individual chapbooks [are] like snowflakes of literary litheness.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sloane Crosley, <i>Vanity Fair </i>Hot Type<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Captivating.&nbsp;A stroke of genius. The most stunning example [of Carson&#x2019;s work] to date. She designs her books to make you rethink entirely the way you read . . . <i>Float </i>invites you to interact with it, to pull it apart and put it back together . . . The way Carson plans the physical reading experience feels like a magnification of what it&#x2019;s like to read a really good poem: not straightforwardly but absorbing the sense of it,&nbsp;sounds and senses playing off one another . . . The poems themselves are designed as intricately as the box itself . . . Carson&#x2019;s work is a question of occupying untranslatable and unpredictable silences, and <i>Float</i> is about finding something whole in fragments. She is a strange and immersive poet. It&#x2019;s only after reading <i>Float </i>in its entirety that you realise its full effect.&#x201d; &#x2014;Charlotte Runcie, <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>(UK)<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re ready to restart your capacity for cosmic delight, vernacular hijinks, and intellectual pizzazz, let inimitable poet, translator, and classicist Anne Carson be your guide in her latest long-form work.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>ELLE</i><br><br>&#x201c;A motley crew steers&nbsp;<i>Float</i>: Husserl, Picasso, Hegel, a chorus of Gertrude Steins, and Carson&#x2019;s noble uncle Harry, not to mention the Greeks: late-arriving Odysseus, howling Cassandra, and a rather tetchy Zeus. What else would you expect from [this] renowned classicist, translator, and polymath? Whether one skims or dives, there are treasures to be found. Two playlets plumb family tragedy; [a piece] about the death of Carson&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s wife is a heartbreaker; [two others] are goofy fun. The whole coheres, and the tether is Carson herself&#x2014;her interests, erudition, and autobiography; the way she thinks, and writes, and occasionally, rhymes.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christine Smallwood,&nbsp;<i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><br><br> &#x201c;Mesmerizing&nbsp;. . . <i>Float</i> should be read by anyone who has any&nbsp;interest in translation, art, beauty, meaning and the possibilities of a poetic work. Carson, renowned poet, translator and classicist, will never disappoint when it comes to her unique combination of tradition and experimentation . . . In this offering, more than any other [work]&nbsp;to date, we see her true depth&nbsp;as both an inventive thinker and deeply gifted lyrical poet.&nbsp;<i>Float</i>&nbsp;touches every register with clarity and wit, as the chapbooks undulate between the serious and silly, the intellectual and the sentimental . . . Carson, once again, has given us something that can only come from her radiant creativity and illustrious intellect.&nbsp;<i>Float</i>&nbsp;is a book of books; no matter how you read them, or in what order, you will be left hypnotized by its daring scope and peerless creativity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nicodemus Nicoludis, <i>Spectrum Culture</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Float</i> exemplifies Carson&#x2019;s masterly use of the creative potential of disorder&nbsp;. . . [It] does more than bounce, it buoys up as uninhibited, cosmic &#x2018;flotage.&#x2019; It requires &#x2018;unpacking&#x2019; because it&nbsp;comes in a clear&nbsp;box containing separate chapbooks of poetry, essays, performance-based texts, and other literary miscellany . . . [But]&nbsp;<i>Float</i>&nbsp;is not a mere victim of entropy&#x2014;it unequivocally embraces it. It contemplates everyone and everything, from Brigitte Bardot to Hegel, from identity to commodification. There is a beauty to its lack of structure: the reader is meant to shuffle, rearrange, and fall apart at his or her own peril . . . It&#x2019;s this beautiful lyricism, Carson has remained true to her sensibilities and artistry . . . Throw the booklets in the air. Regard the flotage.&#x201d; &#x2014;Taylor Kang, <i>The Culture Trip</i><br><br>&#x201c;Carson expands her reputation as a genre-defying innovator with her latest book-as-art-object. This is a freewheeling collection, a wildly open text at one moment deeply philosophical, at the next self-effacing and humorous . . . Each section of these 23 individual chapbooks exhibits its own merits, illuminating some new facet of Carson&#x2019;s intellect or digging deeper furrows into her scholarly pursuits . . . Carson&#x2019;s whirlwinds of thought, simultaneously swelling and coalescing, disrupt traditional framings, upend clich�, and demand a new kind of candor.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(boxed review)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stunning&#x2014;a marriage of penetrating intellect, inspiring language and the art of the book. Anne Carson seems to know everything. In <i>Float, </i>she offers new poetry and prose presented in separately bound chapters, serendipitously arranged in an attractive acetate case. In chapter after chapter Carson surprises. A visit to the library inside Carson&#x2019;s head is always worth standing in line for . . . In beautiful packaging and with a subtle balance of erudition, humor, criticism and lyricism, <i>Float </i>is a jaw-dropping achievement.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bruce Jacobs, <i>Shelf Awareness</i><b><i><br></i></b><br>* &#x201c;A radiant delight . . . a rich gathering of works joining past to present and ancient to modern. Carson is by temperament both experimental poet and traditional classical scholar&#x2014;heavy on linguistic parsing and close reading on the one hand, and lightning bursts of metaphorical insight on the other. This collection, innovatively presented as a series of chapbooks that can be read sequentially or not as the mood strikes, highlights both interests. These chapbooks variously gather lectures, poems, notes, performance pieces, and miscellanea . . . The poems inhabit the country that lies somewhere between late modernism and postmodernism, often reminiscent of W.S. Merwin and, if he were more inclined to lyric, the late Guy Davenport. The prose pieces touch on themes of classical literature and history . . . Readers of whatever description will enjoy watching Carson's nimble mind at play&#x2014;and play is just the word, for Carson caresses words, winds them up and watches them go.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)</p><h2>The Earth Is Enough: Growing Up in a World of Flyfishing, Trout &amp; Old Men (The Pruett Series)</h2><p><p><b>In this touching memoir of his boyhood on a farm in the Ozark foothills, Harry Middleton joins the front rank of nature writers alongside Edward Hoagland and Annie Dillard.</b></p> <p>It is the year 1965, a year rife with change in the world&#x2015;and in the life of a boy whose tragic loss of innocence leads him to the healing landscape of the Ozarks. Haunted by indescribable longing, twelve-year-old Harry is turned over to two enigmatic guardians, men as old as the hills they farm and as elusive and beautiful as the trout they fish for&#x2015;with religious devotion.</p> <p>Seeking strength and purpose from life, Harry learns from his uncle, grandfather, and their eccentric neighbor, Elias Wonder, that the pulse of life beats from within the deep constancy of the earth, and from one's devotion to it. Amidst the rhythm of an ancient cadence, Harry discovers his home: a farm, a mountain stream, and the eye of a trout rising.</p></p><p>It was shortly after reading Harry Middleton's The Earth is Enough that I made the decision to give up trout fishing. Since fishing is one of the things my life has been largely about, perhaps this might indicate the vitality, resonance and power of this book. <p>I discovered Middleton later than most, a function of my suspicion of all things new, especially books, and especially squared books of fiction or books with fishing in them. I was aware of this author, but put off reading him, a gesture not unlike circling a sleeping rattler for several years. </p><p>Now, thinking back, I don't recall exactly what moved me to try. Maybe it was the quotation at the book's beginning by Loren Eiseley, someone I profoundly love and respect. Middleton's own preface was good, too. So, I thought, one page couldn't hurt anything, what was I afraid of? A page it would be then. It was a good one that soon became two, then three, then a blurred rhythm of reading and turning, turning and reading. Everything was there as it should be, the timeless craft of the old, arm in arm with the freshness of a new vision draped around the fundamental constants of life, death, love, God and family. </p><p>This is a book about love for all things that matter. In this case, one of those things is a simple fish, brook trout to be specific, brook trout living in Starlight Creek which runs through a poor Ozark farm. It is a book about a boy, three men, and a dog; it is the story of youth and age, and of learning. Like A River Runs Through It, this tale is based on fact, shaped by fiction, and the grace of it comes from the seamless combination of the two. Unlike MacLean's book, which is inevitably ruled by an abiding Scottish sternness, Middleton's work is something of an organic loose cannon, the texture plush and full of real surprises. In common with A River Runs Through It, the elements of humanity, time and place are made rich and true and enervating through genuine passion. Middleton's passion is manifested through intelligence, sensitivity and compassion to create a profound ode to the earth and to mankind, governed by respect, gentleness and humor. At all the appropriate moments this story will make you weep convulsively, burst out laughing, and cause you to ache with longing. The sadness is that these qualities certainly contributed to the doom of their creator. Passion and soul, the dual sources of everything valuable and meaningful, are not very hot commodities in our largely puritanical, Calvinistic, money-driven republic. In a society like ours, layered with ennui, greed, aggressive ignorance, dispassionate, poor-quality living, all soaked in a gooey solution of snake-belly-grade voyeurism a la Oprah et al., the sensitive frequently don't make it. </p><p>Shortly after reading all of Middleton's books the first time around, I called Jim Pruett, publisher of this current edition (whose urging to read them in the first place I ignored) because I wanted badly to get off a congratulatory letter to Mr. Middleton and I needed his address. Too late, Jim said, he just passed away. I'm only going to whine for a minute because, as Jim Harrison is fond of advising whiners, Go tell it to Anne Frank. To which I might add Dylan Thomas, or Rilke, or Calvin Kentfield, or Ray Carver, or Richard Hugo, or Don Carpenter, or Richard Brautigan, etc., etc. Self-pity won't get you a packet of ketchup at the cheapest restaurant on earth. But it still hurts to know that Harry Middleton rode the back of a garbage truck every night during the wee hours to put groceries on his family's table. All too frequently, in addition to endless money problems, many artists have difficult personalities and/or drinking problems, three omnipresent occupational speed bumps, any or all of which can be fatal. </p><p>At the end of this beautiful book, a young Harry Middleton takes a break from school to go back and visit the place where the story takes place. Standing on the hillside in the rain, he reflects: </p><p>All three men were there . . . . They were of the earth, totally, completely. I stood in the rain for a long time, just looking and trying not to think at all, for I had no wish to make judgments, nor to seek answers, nor harvest messages. It was only important that I had come one last time to this place, a boy's sanctuary. His solace. His home. </p><p>How dull the stones looked in the rain against the black-browed hills, the dark sky. Only here in these mountains, here with these old men, amid the creek, the trout, the natural world, had I ever ceased to feel alone. I recalled those winter nights on the roof of the farmhouse when we waited for the geese to come overhead and I'd felt like a giant nautilus adrift in a boundless sea. Yet how contented had I felt, even in that reverie, for all I was, all I would be, was inexorably with me there in my chambered shell. Albert, Emerson, Norwell, Elias Wonder, the wildness of the mountains, all of it was with me, and the weight of it all, my time here, set my course, marked my way. So it was still; so it would always be. </p><p>Russell Chatham Livingston, Montana 1995</p>It is the year 1965, a year rife with change in the world--an in the life of a boy whose tragic loss of innocence leads him to the healing landscape of the Ozarks.

As he painstakingly prepared his lectures, he gradually realized, and then embraced, the book&#x2019;s central theme&#x2014;salvation is by grace alone through faith alone. That spark of truth ignited Martin Luther&#x2019;s own spiritual life and the fires of reformation that would follow.</p> <p>Luther&#x2019;s <em>Commentary on Romans</em> presents the very earliest developments of Luther&#x2019;s evangelical theology, which he described as &#x201c;the theology of the Cross.&#x201d; This popular edition, translated by Theodore Mueller, organizes Luther&#x2019;s notes for modern readers, using explanatory subheadings and parenthetical comments to clarify the great Reformer&#x2019;s thoughts. Some views, which Luther later modified or discarded, have been omitted in order to avoid confusion with his later works. The result is a text that is concise, practical, and devotional.</p> <p><strong>Martin Luther</strong> (1483&#x2013;1546) left his comfortable upbringing to become a Roman Catholic monk and later a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg in Saxony. His study and teaching of the Greek text of the New Testament represent the beginnings of modern textual study, and his widely disseminated writings sparked the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Other works by Luther include <em>Commentary on Galatians</em> and <em>Commentary on First and Second Peter and Jude</em>. </p>Martin Luther (1483&#x2013;1546) was born in Germany and is famous for his protest, The Ninety-five Theses, which he nailed to the door of the castle church of Wittenberg. The son of middle-class parents, Luther left his comfortable life to become a monk. Luther&#x2019;s own spiritual awakening was sparked by his study of the Greek text of Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Romans, which challenged him with the statement, &#x201c;The just shall live by faith.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Ch&#39;i-lin Purse: A Collection of Ancient Chinese Stories (Sunburst Book)</h2><p><p>A <i>Storytelling World </i>magazine award winner</p><p>In turns funny, poignant, and wise, these nine lively stories are peopled with an array of unusual characters, including a young woman raised as a boy who is then faced with the complicated business of marriage; a carp-fish spirit who changes herself into a young woman for love's sake; a Miracle Doctor who can cure all illnesses except one; and a shopkeeper who learns the hard way the true meaning of justice.</p></p><p><p><b>Linda Fang</b> is a storyteller and educator who specializes in bringing Chinese tales to American audiences.

Retellings are vivid, lively, and read aloud well. Many have a moral, and all are entertaining; some, like the eponymous story, are quite moving. "The Two Miss Peonys" has appeared in its Sino-Vietnamese version in Lynette Vuong's The Golden Carp (Lothrop, 1993). A list of sources with Fang's commentary is appended, including admission of any changes?in all but one case minor?to the original material. A pronunciation guide and glossary appear in the back of the book. In the former, the author explains with specious reasoning her misguided decision to use the antiquated, inaccurate Wade-Giles transcription for Chinese names and terms; even on its own terms, this guide leaves lots unexplained. Also, defining Chinese terms in a glossary instead of in context only impedes the narrative flow. The black-and-white illustrations?one per selection?are graceful, depicting widely different epochs with amazing accuracy.

It invites us to say yes to "the possibility of God", and to recover "this fantastic hope that the future belongs to God...that holiness will return to our world."</p></p><p>In the first essay in this beautiful collection of reflections on biblical themes, Frederick Buechner reminds us of a famous scene in the film <i>La Dolce Vita</i>: a helicopter is flying overhead, and suspended below it is a statue of Jesus. It flies over a swimming pool where a group of girls lounge; the men flying above circle back, trying to get the girls' phone numbers. All of this is immensely amusing to everyone in the audience, Buechner writes, until the camera zooms in on the statue itself, "until just for a moment the screen is filled with just the bearded face of Christ. For a moment, he continues, the theater was silent, "as if the face were their face somehow, their secret face that they had never seen before but that they knew belonged to them." This, he concludes, "is much of what the Christian faith is." <p> We catch a glimpse of something true, Buechner tells us, and after that glimpse we are never again the same, try as we might to forget it.

Superficially just a good missionary story, about how one man brought a number of groups of Masai people in east Africa to Christian faith, it is something much more than that. For in what the author says about the method and content of evangelism; the meaning of the eucharist; and the nature of ministry, we are led back to the question our understandings of the mission of the church in all its contexts. For Donovan, his experiences in Africa meant a total reappraisal of the meaning of his faith, and therefore a rediscovery of his Christianity. His book, which is written with moving simplicity, continues to represent a provocative challenge to all those engaged in issues of evangelism and multiculturalism.</p><p>Donovan, a Spiritan priest, spent seventeen years in Tanzania before returning to ministry in the U.S.</p><h2>Unified: How Our Unlikely Friendship Gives Us Hope for a Divided Country</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b><br><br>In a divided country desperate for unity, two sons of South Carolina show how different races, life experiences, and pathways can lead to a deep friendship&#x2015;even in a state that was rocked to its core by the 2015 Charleston church shooting.<br><br>Tim Scott, an African-American US senator, and Trey Gowdy, a white US congressman, won&#x2019;t allow racial lines to divide them.

Green calls himself a &#x201c;stove-up old cowboy,&#x201d; and readers of this book will learn soon enough where the broken bones came from. Green tells of his adventures with wild steers, sharing with readers the years he worked in thorny brush and canyon country delivering those animals that were too wily or too wild for the normal roundup. Finding them was hard, even dangerous, work. Few cowboys looked for such chores. Green declares, &#x201c;I got real good at it, but of course in those days I didn&#x2019;t know any better.&#x201d;</p><p>Ben K. Green may have not known better than to circulate around the West with a little remuda of cow-wise ponies hunting out recalcitrant old steers, but he certainly knew how to tell these stories.

The moon, not quite full, was a yellow halo, dull and yet glaring. Around the moon a red ring gave off an ominous glow. A dangerous time, this cycle of the moon, especially when the mist came in thick and heavy, covering the ground a foot or so high, winding in and out of the trees as if alive. The mist muffled sound, dulled the senses, giving advantages to the shadowy figures that preyed upon the unwary.</p><p>Tatijana of the Dragonseekers woke beneath the earth with layers of dark, rich healing loam surrounding her. Vital nutrients, rich in minerals cushioned her body. She lay for a long time, panicked, listening to her own heart beating, feeling too light, too trapped, too exposed. And hot. So hot. Above her, she sensed the guardians. Watching over her, they said, and it was probably true, but she&#x2019;d been a prisoner for so long&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been born into captivity&#x2014;and she trusted no one other than her sister, Branislava. Bronnie lay sleeping peacefully, very close to her, her only comfort. Her heartbeat grew louder until it was thunder in her ears. She couldn&#x2019;t stand being trapped beneath the earth. She had to get out, to find freedom.</p><p>To feel free. What was that like? She knew nothing of the world. She&#x2019;d lived underground her entire life, deep in the ice caves, never seeing or speaking to anyone other than those who tortured and tried to terrorize her. She knew no other life, but that had changed&#x2014;or had it?</p><p>Had Bronnie and she exchanged one cold, frightening prison for a silken cage? If so, their wardens had made a huge mistake putting them in the ground to recover. She hardly knew what it was like to be in her real form. She&#x2019;d spent centuries in dragon form and dragons could move through earth fairly easily.</p><p>Bronnie, she whispered into her sister&#x2019;s mind. I know you need your sleep. I will continue to explore our new world and come back at dawn with new information.</p><p>Branislava stirred in her mind as if she might protest as she had each time Tatijana told her she was going.</p><p>I need to do this.</p><p>I will come with you, Bronnie answered, her voice far away, even though she was in Tatijana&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>Tatijana knew Branislava would force herself to awaken, although she wasn&#x2019;t truly healed inside, where they both needed it. They&#x2019;d done everything together&#x2014;been through the worst together. They&#x2019;d never actually been apart, even when encased in ice, when they could only stare at one another. They still had telepathic communication.</p><p>Not this time, Bronnie, I need to do this for me. She whispered the words as she did on the occasions she awakened to explore their new world. She always gave Bronnie reassurance that she would be careful.</p><p>No one would ever imprison either of them again. Every rising she made that simple vow. She was growing stronger with each passing night. Power ran through her body and with it, confidence. She was determined they would stand on their own and be beholden to no one.</p><p>Tatijana didn&#x2019;t know how to tell her sister she didn&#x2019;t want to live under the rules of another. They were Carpathian. Dragonseeker. That meant something to the prince of the Carpathians and to all the others. The males were lining up in the hopes of claiming either Bronnie, or her. She could not live under the rule of another. She just couldn&#x2019;t do it. She didn&#x2019;t want anyone telling her what to do ever again, even if it was for her own good. She rose when she wanted and explored her new world on her own terms.</p><p>Tatijana made up her mind that she would find her own way, learn her own way, make her own mistakes. Bronnie was always the voice of reason. She protected Tatijana from her impulsive nature, but no more. As much as she loved Branislava, this was something Tatijana needed. </p><p>She sent her sister love and warmth and the promise she would return at dawn. Shapeshifting into the appearance of a blue dragon was easy&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been in the form for centuries and the structure and shape felt more familiar than her own body. She burrowed deeper, going into the earth rather than rising where her guardians would see her. She&#x2019;d already dug a tunnel, and she moved quickly through the packed soil. She&#x2019;d chosen to exit several kilometers away from her resting place in order to ensure Branislava&#x2019;s safety and to make certain the guardians would have no idea she&#x2019;d risen early. The blue dragon moved through the tunnel like a mole, digging when necessary, packing any dirt that had collapsed as she hurried steadily toward her goal.</p><p>Tatijana emerged in a deep forest. She was very careful to scan the earth above her before the blue dragon poked her wedge-shaped head out of the hidden entrance. She surfaced in the midst of a thick gray fog. Trees appeared as giant misshapen scarecrows with outstretched arms, swaying slightly, just enough to give them the appearance of monsters.</p><p>Tatijana had known real monsters and the dense forest of trees veiled in gray didn&#x2019;t alarm her in the least. Freedom was amazing. Her eyes were terribly sensitive, but other than that, the world felt as if it was hers and with the fog covering the ground, her eyes didn&#x2019;t even burn.</p><p>She shifted to her physical form, donning modern clothing, a pair of soft cotton pants that allowed her freedom of movement. She&#x2019;d chosen a blouse she&#x2019;d seen on a woman in the village a couple of nights earlier. She&#x2019;d followed the woman, studying her style of clothing so she could reproduce it at will. Everything seemed strange to her, but that was part of the excitement of discovery. She wanted tactile learning, not just pulling information from another&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>She made her way through the forest, enjoying the way the fog wrapped around her legs and made her feel as if she was walking through clouds. She remembered at the last moment to add shoes, something that was still very uncomfortable for her. She felt as if the shoes weighed her down and felt very foreign on her body.</p><p>The wind rushed through the trees, kicking up leaves and swirling mist around tree trunks. The mist began to rise from the floor as she walked toward the only light at the forest&#x2019;s edge that she could see. Music poured from the building, singing to her, beckoning, but this time she knew she wasn&#x2019;t going just to hear those beautiful notes. She normally chose a different location every night to glean more information to share with her sister.</p><p>This place called to her every rising now. The feeling was so strong it was nearly a compulsion. She had resisted for a few days, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop herself another night. She drew closer to the building. The windows were lit with that same yellow glow, two eyes staring at her through the thick mist. A chill went down her spine, but she kept walking toward it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Wild Boar Tavern sat on the very edge of the forest, surrounded on three sides by heavy brush, trees, and plenty of cover for anyone needing to hide quickly. Providing shelter and camaraderie as well as easy exits should the law happen to venture near, the tavern offered regulars comfort by the fire, warm food and plenty to drink. The crowd was rough, no place for the timid, and even the law generally avoided the place. No one asked questions and everyone was careful not to officially notice anything.</p><p>Fenris Dalka came to the tavern nearly every night, so why did he feel such a fool sitting at the bar, slowly nursing a beer, pretending to drink it like he often did? He huffed out his breath and kept his gaze forward, using the mirror to keep an eye on the door. From his vantage point, he could see every corner of the tavern as well as the door. He&#x2019;d scoped out the perfect place to sit some time ago and now, if he came in and someone was sitting there, he just stood over them, staring, until they got up and vacated his seat.</p><p>Fen knew he was intimidating and he used his rough, dangerous looks to his advantage. He was tall enough, but it was his broad shoulders and thick chest, his roped arms and five o&#x2019;clock shadow, the piercing glacier-blue eyes he used to look right through someone into their soul that usually intimidated people. He rarely had to speak and he preferred it that way. The regulars knew him and knew to leave him alone.</p><p>Music played in the background and laughter occasionally rang out, but for the most part, the patrons spoke in hushed whispers. Only the bartender ever spoke to Fen when he entered. A few of the regulars lifted a hand, or nodded, but most avoided his eyes. He looked nearly as dangerous as he was. A man with no friends, trusting only his brother and always hunted or hunting. He was even more ruthless and brutal than the whispers said.</p><p>His hair was long, very thick and distinctly silver with black strands woven into the waves falling down his back. Most of the time he secured it at his nape with a leather cord to keep it out of his eyes. He had large hands, and his knuckles were scarred. There were scars on his face, one up near his eye and another that ran from his eye halfway down his face. There were far more scars on his body. Centuries of defending himself, every battle and every victory was stamped into his bones.</p><p>Whispered conversations were easy enough to listen in on with his acute hearing, allowing him to glean a tremendous amount of information. But tonight was different. He wasn&#x2019;t here for information . . . he was drawn . . . compelled by something altogether different this time.</p><p>Uncomfortable, he played with his beer mug, moving his fingers over the handle, gripping with his fist and forcing himself to let go before he shattered the glass. He wasn&#x2019;t a man to do another&#x2019;s bidding. He didn&#x2019;t trust anything he couldn&#x2019;t understand&#x2014;and he didn&#x2019;t understand the urgent need that kept him coming back night after night, waiting.</p><p>This was a tavern for the lawless. For clandestine meetings. He and his brother had discovered the tavern when he&#x2019;d first arrived back in the Carpathian Mountains. It had been necessary to find a safe place, out of the way, where they could spend time and talk unseen by anyone who might know either of them. He wanted to make absolutely certain that his younger brother was safe. No one could know they were brothers. No one could ever associate the two of them, or he would be putting his sibling&#x2019;s life on the line&#x2014;something he wasn&#x2019;t willing to do. So many years had passed that everyone had forgotten him&#x2014;or thought him dead&#x2014;and for his brother&#x2019;s protection that falsehood had to remain.</p><p>He knew every face in the tavern. Most had been coming even longer than he had. The newest patron was the most suspect. He had arrived in the area only a couple of weeks earlier. He had the stocky build of a hunter&#x2014;a woodsman&#x2014;yet he dressed more refined. He was not someone to take lightly. Anyone could see by the way he moved that he would be good in a fight. He was definitely armed. He went by the name of Zev, and clearly he was new to the area. He hadn&#x2019;t disclosed his business, but Fen would bet his last dollar, he was hunting someone. He didn&#x2019;t look like the law, but he was definitely pursuing someone. Fen hoped it wasn&#x2019;t him, but if it was, he took every opportunity to study Zev, the way he moved, which hand he favored, where his weapons were carried.</p><p>Zev wore his hair longer than usual, just as Fen did. His hair was a deep chestnut color and very thick, much like a rich pelt. His eyes were gray and watchful, always moving, always restless, while his body remained quite still. Fen found it significant that no one in the bar had yet challenged him.</p><p>The wind picked up, rushing through the trees, capricious and playful, pushing branches against the sides of the tavern so that they creaked and scraped, a heralding of danger if one could read the information the wind provided. Fen let out his breath and glanced through the window into the dark forest.</p><p>The mist snaked through the trees, stretching out like greedy fingers, winding in and out of the trees, closeting the forest in a thick veil of gray. He needed to go&#x2014;now&#x2014;he only had five days before the full moon&#x2014;that gave him two days to find a safe place to ride out the threat to him. The three days before the full moon, the full moon and the three days after were the most dangerous for him. Yet he didn&#x2019;t move from the barstool, not even when self-preservation screamed at him. Every hair on his body was raised, both in alarm and extended as antenna to catch the smallest of details.</p><p>He smeared cold beads of sweat on the glass, his gaze drawn to the mirror once again. He did not have the full range of the color spectrum, but the dimmer the light, the more shades of gray he could see. He couldn&#x2019;t tell the difference between yellow, green or orange, they all looked the same to him&#x2014;a dull yellowish color. Red looked brownish gray or black, but he could detect blue. What he lacked in his abilities to distinguish color, he more than made up with his acute hearing, sense of smell and his long-range eyesight.</p><p>Her scent reached him as she opened the door. A woman. The woman. Was she bait to catch him? If so, he was hooked. That scent of hers&#x2014;fresh earth, the forest, wild honey, of dark secret places and the night itself, drew him as no expensive perfume ever could. She&#x2019;d been coming on and off to the tavern for the last week. Three visits, and yet he was already under her spell. </p><p>She&#x2019;d captured him effortlessly, without doing anything but walking through the door. He&#x2019;d never seen a woman so beautiful or alluring. She literally stopped all conversation the moment she entered, but she never seemed to notice. And that was the trouble. She was far too young and naive, far too innocent-looking to come unescorted to a place like this one.</p><p>He&#x2019;d heard the whispers of some of the men and he knew she wasn&#x2019;t safe. The two barmaids glared at her, aware that the moment she came in, they no longer had the attention of the men. Again, the woman seemed completely unaware. She walked with confidence, but she seemed to pay no attention to the predators surrounding her&#x2014;and they were predators. The only reason she hadn&#x2019;t been attacked so far was because he&#x2019;d made it very clear she was under his protection. When one of the men had started to make his move on her, Fen had stood up. That was all. He just stood up.</p><p>The man subsided instantly and no one had dared make another move, but it was only a matter of time. From what he heard, three conspirators planned to follow her when she left the tavern and Fen wouldn&#x2019;t be around to protect her. Well, that was unfair. Two conspirators and one friend trying to talk sense into them. He could have told them not to put their money on that plan and that listening to their friend was the better idea, but he didn&#x2019;t bother. He rolled his shoulders slowly, open and closed his fists, stretching out his fingers and looking down at the hands that could be such deadly weapons. He needed the exercise.</p><p>He watched her in the mirror. He&#x2019;d seen her try a drink each time she came in, one she&#x2019;d obviously seen someone else drink, and each time she made a horrible face and spit the liquor back into the glass, shook her headand moved away from the bar to the tiny area where she could dance. Again she seemed completely oblivious to those around her, losing herself in the music. Fen was certain she came to th...</p></p><h2>Mastering Your Hidden Self: A Guide to the Huna Way (A Quest Book)</h2><p>Huna philosophy is about learning to become a conscious cocreator with the Universe.

The trick was to sound friendly and helpful, not too eager for a sale.<br><br>The girl turned to me, and tears glistened in her big green eyes. "I don't know. I'm supposed to pick up a gift for my boyfriend's father. It's his birthday, and the party starts in a half hour. I'm doomed!"<br><br>"I'm sure he would love any book that you give him," I said encouragingly. "It's the thought that counts, right?"<br><br>She shook her head and her brown hair covered her face. "You don't know his parents. They're horrible. Nothing I do is right. I just want them to like me or at least pretend to."<br><br>I straightened a row of books that sat unevenly on the shelf. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Grandma Daisy had moved the books just a little to drive me crazy. She and I had different ideas on the proper way to keep the books organized. I wanted everything in its place, preferably in alphabetical order. Grandma Daisy was satisfied if books were on the correct floor of the shop. She always said the books would find the person who needed them most no matter where they were in the shop, so precision didn't matter. That might be literally true in Charming Books, but still the alphabetizer in me couldn't handle the lackadaisical shelving method. After the books' spines were all sitting precisely at the edge, I said, "That sounds familiar."<br><br>She wrinkled her nose. "What does that mean?"<br><br>I gave her a half smile. "My high school boyfriend's parents didn't like me either."<br><br>"What would they have bad to say about you?" She blinked at me. "You're so tall and pretty."<br><br>I chuckled. "Being tall isn't everything. Neither is being pretty. That's sweet of you to say that I am, though. You're a beautiful girl, so if that argument didn't work for you, it most certainly wouldn't work for me."<br><br>She blushed at the compliment and said, "If your boyfriend's parents didn't like you, I really am in trouble. Maybe I should just go to his birthday party empty-handed. Why waste my money when it's not going to do any good?"<br><br>"Maybe you just need to let your subconscious pick the book," I said.<br><br>She lowered her eyebrows. "What do you mean?"<br><br>"Close your eyes and reach for the books. I think the right book will find you."<br><br>She gave me a dubious look.<br><br>I shrugged. "It's just a hunch. What do you have to lose?"<br><br>"Oh-kay." Her voice was still heavy with doubt.<br><br>While the girl's eyes were closed, a book flew across the shop from the history section and appeared in her hand.<br><br>Her eyes snapped open, and she stared at the tome with Abraham Lincoln on the cover. "How did this get in the sports section?"<br><br>"Oh," I said unconcernedly. "It must have been misplaced. Would you prefer a sports-related title?" I moved to take the book from her.<br><br>"No!" She jerked the book away from me and held it to her chest. "No, this is perfect. His father is a history buff, and I've seen a picture of Lincoln in his office. I'm only afraid he might have already read this one."<br><br>I fought to hide a smile. "I'm pretty sure he hasn't read it."<br><br>"How do you know?" She stared up at me with those big green eyes again.<br><br>"Call it bookseller intuition." I smiled.<br><br>She hugged the book more tightly to her chest. "This is the right book. I just know it. Thank you so much. . . ." She trailed off.<br><br>"Violet," I said.<br><br>"You really saved my life with this."<br><br>"Happy to help. Let's ring you up, then, so you can make that party." I led her across the room to the sales counter.<br><br>Faulkner, the shop crow, walked across the counter. His talons made a clicking sound on the aged wood. I clapped my hands at him, and he flew over the girl's head, cawing, "Four score and seven years ago!"<br><br>She ducked, and her eyes went round. "Was the crow quoting the Gettysburg Address? Does he know about this book?"<br><br>I forced a laugh. "We've been playing a lot of historical audiobooks in the shop lately. He must have picked it up from that."<br><br>While she reached in her purse for her wallet, I glared at Faulkner, who landed on one of the low branches of the birch tree. The crow smoothed his silky black feathers with his sharp beak and ignored me. I wondered where my tuxedo cat, Emerson, had gone off to. He usually was able to keep the crow in line. Also it was never a good sign when Emerson wandered off. The cat was up to something or strolling around the neighborhood. I hadn't yet figured out how to keep my cat in the shop. His previous owner took him all around town.<br><br>She swiped her credit card through the machine.<br><br>"Would you like me to gift wrap the book for you?"<br><br>"Can you? That would be great and save me so much time. I'm already running late as it is."<br><br>"Of course." I cut off a piece of brown paper stamped with orange and red leaves from the roll behind the counter.<br><br>After the girl took the newly wrapped biography out the front door, I locked the door behind her and winked at the birch tree that grew in the middle of the bookshop. A spiral staircase led up to the second floor of Charming Books, where the children's fairy book loft and my one-bedroom apartment were. My ancestress Rosalee had built the original house around the tree after the War of 1812. "Nice work." I gave the tree a thumbs-up.<br><br>My seventysomething grandmother, who with her trim figure could easily pass for a woman half her age if not for the sleek silver bob that fell to her chin, came around the side of the tree, shaking her head. "Violet, my dear, you're becoming a little showy with helping customers choose books. What if someone else was in the shop when you pulled that stunt? It would not do for customers to see books flying across the shop." As usual, she wore jeans and a Charming Books sweatshirt, which was orange that day in celebration of the nearness of Halloween. To complete the outfit, she'd added a gauzy infinity scarf decorated with cheerful jack-o'-lanterns.<br><br>"Grandma Daisy, it's after seven. The shop was supposed to close fifteen minutes ago. There was no one else here."<br><br>"Still, you need to be careful." She tucked a lock of silver hair behind her ear. "Remember the most important job of the Caretaker is to keep the shop's secret. No one outside of the family can know."<br><br>"Four months ago you were arguing with me because I didn't believe in the shop's essence. Now I'm in trouble because I do and make use of it." I couldn't keep the whine out of my voice. I knew I sounded like a stubborn four-year-old, and I knew it wasn't attractive on a woman nearing her thirtieth birthday.<br><br>Grandma Daisy adjusted her cat's-eye glasses on her nose. "You're not in trouble. I just want you to remember your duty as the Caretaker." She turned and headed in the direction of the kitchen, which was separated from the shop by a thick swinging door.<br><br>Like I could forget? Being the Caretaker of the huge Queen Anne Victorian house and its birch tree had been a duty of the women in my family for the last two centuries, ever since Rosalee watered the tree with the mystical and healing waters from the local natural springs. The water manifested itself in the shop and the books, and now the essence of the water was able to communicate with the Caretaker through cryptic messages sent through the books themselves. Trust me-I know how unbelievable that sounds.<br><br>My mother should have been the Caretaker after my grandmother was relieved of her post, but fate had other plans, stealing her from me when I was only thirteen. As a result, the Caretaker role skipped a generation and landed directly on my shoulders. Since I had no children, female or otherwise, it was unknown what would happen to the shop when it was time for me to pass it on to the next generation. I would love to have a child . . . someday. I rolled my eyes at Grandma Daisy's receding back. There was really no way I could forget my duty as the Caretaker of Charming Books even if I wanted to.<br><br>"I saw you roll your eyes at me," Grandma Daisy called over her shoulder.<br><br>"The essence doesn't give you the ability to see out the back of your head," I countered.<br><br>She glanced over her shoulder. "How do you know? You've only been the Caretaker for a few months. How do you know everything the essence can and cannot do?" Before I could think of a smart remark, she said, "Don't you have some cookies to be picked up from La Crepe Jolie for the Poe-try Reading tomorrow?"<br><br>I smacked myself on the forehead. "Oh, right, I forgot. I'll go collect them now."<br><br>She nodded. "The Red Inkers should be here by the time you return. Be careful. The traffic will be horrid on River Road with the start of the Food and Wine Festival tomorrow."<br><br>"I'll be careful," I promised.<br><br>The Cascade Springs Food and Wine Festival was the biggest event for the small village, which depended on tourism for its survival. It was held annually the third week of October. This year at Grandma Daisy's urging, Charming Books was participating in the festivities by hosting a Poe-try Reading, highlighting the work and life of the master of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe. I couldn't think of a more perfect author to showcase this close to Halloween. Grandma Daisy and I were able to recruit the help of the Red Inkers, a local writers' group that regularly met in Charming Books after shop hours to discuss their work.<br><br>I grabbed my coat from the coat-tree by the kitchen door. "I should be going, then."<br><br>"Don't be too long. I know everyone in the group is looking forward to seeing you. . . ." she said in a teasing voice.<br><br>This time I rolled my eyes to her face, so there was no mistaking it. Grandma Daisy's bell-chime laugh rang through the empty shop, and Faulkner joined in on the chuckle fest. Her comment about the group wanting to see me was much more pointed than it sounded. She implied-not so subtly, might I add-that the village police chief, David Rainwater, wanted to see me.<br><br>The truth was I was looking forward to seeing him too.<br><br>Two<br><br>Outside the shop, I walked around Charming Books to collect my bicycle. I wished that my grandmother hadn't brought up David Rainwater, even if indirectly. Now I knew I would be fretting over seeing him until the Red Inkers meeting. The police chief, who was an aspiring children's book author, was also a member. Seeing him wasn't a complication that I needed. I had enough to worry about between being the shop Caretaker, finishing my dissertation on Ralph Waldo Emerson and his Transcendentalist buddies, and teaching my adjunct courses at the local community college. Now was not a good time to think about finding a boyfriend, no matter how beautiful he was, and David Rainwater was beautiful. The female and even some of the male population of the village could vouch for that.<br><br>My aqua-colored cruiser bike leaned against the side of the shop. It had been my mother's, and Grandma Daisy had it refurbished as part of her master plan to convince me to stay in the village and accept my role as Caretaker of Charming Books. She had also had my bike helmet "improved" by asking a local artist to cover it in hand-painted purple violets. The helmet was beyond embarrassing, but it brought a smile to my grandmother's face every time I wore it, so I couldn't bring myself to buy a violet-free replacement. I lifted the helmet from where it dangled from the handlebars. As I fastened the chin strap into place, Emerson flew out from under Charming Books' wraparound porch and leaped into the bike's pink wire basket. The gerbera daisy on the front of the basket bounced with the impact.<br><br>"Emerson, you can't come with me this time."<br><br>He stared at me with his big amber eyes.<br><br>I put my hands on my hips, determined not to let him get the best of me. "How am I supposed to bring the cookies home with you in the basket? Do you want the cookies to be ruined?"<br><br>He flattened his ears and cocked his head. It was his most pitiful face, which caused me to cave every single time.<br><br>I shook my finger at him. "I mean it. You can't come."<br><br>The old-fashioned ironwork lampposts flickered to life as the sun made its downturn west. I didn't want to be biking cookies back to Charming Books in the dark. I didn't have time for Emerson's stubbornness.<br><br>The tuxie crouched lower in the basket and dug his claws into the towel I kept there to make the ride more comfortable for him. If the towel was any indication, Emerson and I both knew who would win this one.<br><br>I sighed. There was no arguing with the cat when he dug his claws in. "Fine, you win. Again."<br><br>He purred and settled into the bottom of the basket as I set off from Charming Books. At the curb, I paused to take a look at the periwinkle blue Victorian with its tower, delicate gingerbread, and wraparound porch. Sometimes, I still couldn't believe I was living and working there again after over a decade away. I smiled. It felt right. At some point over the last four months, I had accepted my prodigal return to the village and my place as the Caretaker of the shop. Grudgingly, I admitted to myself Grandma Daisy's warning had been just-I needed to be more careful not to reveal what the shop's essence could do. I kicked off from the sidewalk.<br><br>The ride between Charming Books and La Crepe Jolie was typically a short one. The village was so tiny that a bike ride from end to end took no more than fifteen minutes.</p><h2>Major Dudes: A Steely Dan Companion</h2><p>At its core a creative marriage between Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, Steely Dan recorded several of the cleverest and best-produced albums of the 1970s, making them one of the most successful rock acts of the past 50 years. <i>Major Dudes</i> collects some of the smartest and wittiest interviews Becker and Fagen have ever given, along with intelligent reviews of&#x2014;and commentary on&#x2014; their extraordinary songs.

His control over his subjects was so complete that he literally shaped every aspect of their lives the slightest defiance of his authority meant torture and death. Marrin carefully traces the forces that framed Hitler's fanaticism; readers will learn of his hardhearted and abusive father and his doting and indulgent mother who continually schooled Adolf in his superiority over other children. When he is twice rejected at a prestigious art school in Vienna, Hitler's delusional thoughts of himself seek a scapegoat for his seething anger. This was the genesis of Hitler's raging anti-Semitism that would play out in the deaths of over six million. Hitler's path to power included a heroic career as an infantryman in World War I where he earned six medals for bravery, including the Iron Cross. But Germany's surrender plunged him into a dark depression. In this state he began to believe he was called by God to "right Germany's wrongs, rebuild her armies, and punish the traitors." The rest is history, and Marrin brings the tragedy of Hitler's dark reign to the young adult reader in a manner that is honest, forthright and sobering. Illustrated with maps and photographs.</p></p><p>Albert Marrin is a professor of history who, in more than twenty juvenile nonfiction books, has attempted to make the past accessible to young readers. In award-winning books such as <i>1812: The War Nobody Won</i>, <i>Cowboys, Indians, and Gunfighters: The Story of the Cattle Kingdom</i>, and <i>"Unconditional Surrender": U. S. Grant and the Civil War</i>, he has created a tapestry of United States history by focusing on dramatic moments and famous personalities. With biographies of leaders and tyrants from Napoleon to Hitler, Marrin has also interpreted the events of a larger world stage for juvenile readers. Additionally, his several books on the First and Second World Wars provide well-organized introductions to many aspects of those struggles. <p> Chairman of the history department at New York's Yeshiva University, Marrin's books for young readers complement his academic duties and writings. One of his earliest such books, <i>Victory in the Pacific</i>, is indicative of Marrin's thorough, no-nonsense approach to history. -Albert Marrin from <i>Authors and Artists for Young Adults</i>. �2005-2006 Thomson Gale, a part of the Thomson Corporation. All rights reserved. </p><p> Dr. Albert Marrin is a master at weaving personal perspective and historical material smoothly to give readers an interesting and reliable account of the subject. He has written over two dozen award-winning nonfiction books for young people which have been called "addictive reading" by <em>The Horn Book</em>. This is a wonderful clue to the type of author Marrin is. We at BFB respect his work and are so pleased to be publishing several of his titles. Three of his books, including <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Stalin: Russia's Man of Steel</i>, were <em>School Library Journal</em> Best Books of the Year.</p>Grade 6-9 Hitler's life is inseparable from Hitler's Germany and Hitler's war, so it is not surprising that, after describing the dictator's childhood and youth in Austria, Marrin turns away from personal biography to describe life in Nazi Germany and then to recount the campaigns of World War II. Throughout the history of events, however, he points to the influence of the dictator, his increasingly irrational drive to consummate his racial policies, and his responsibility for major military decisions. Marrin brings to this biography a wealth of background information. The author is scrupulous in mentioning sources, and he makes liberal use of quotations, statistics, popular sayings, and other factual material. While not a complete biography, the book emphasizes facts that young readers should know about the impact of Hitler's policies on the lives of the German people, the controls exercised over a whole society, and the horrors of the Second World War. In comparison to available literature on this period of history, Marrin's book stands out for its lively writing, its emphasis on personal anecdote, its value as a reference source, and its insight into the nature of totalitarianism. It is an excellent addition to any library.

He has won the American Book Award and earned accolades from the American Library Association and the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Mr. Moser lives in western Massachusetts.Like a cherished photograph album, this portrait of Appalachia by two natives of the region is suffused with memories made golden by time. Beginning with the dogs that are "named Prince or King" and live in towns "with names like Coal City and Sally's Backbone," Rylant moves to the people, their houses and their activities. Neither story nor factual treatise, the text offers pure nostalgia--a skillfully structured essay that appears, deceptively, to meander like a dusty country lane and underscores the warmth, generosity of spirit and steadfastness of the inhabitants of the "shimmering painted mountains." Rylant is frequently effusive: "The men and women and children who live in Appalachia have no sourness about them," she says; and "The children love all the seasons." But when she focuses on particular details, lyricism suffuses her prose: the "mountains wear heavy shawls of fog, and giant moths flap at the porch lights while cars cut through the dark hollows like burrowing moles." Moser's masterfully executed paintings--from the stretching coon dog to the biscuits that wait on the iron stove--find beauty in plainness, capturing the culture and people of the hollows with affection and sensitivity.

The early teachings, he suggests, offer the foremost example of an active spirituality that is opposed to the more passive, modern forms of theistic religions. This sophisticated, highly readable analysis of the theory and practice of Buddhist asceticism, first published in Italian in 1943 , elucidates the central truths of the eightfold path and clears away the later accretions of Buddhist doctrine. Evola describes the techniques for conscious liberation from the world of maya and for achieving the state of transcendence beyond dualistic thinking. Most surprisingly, he argues that the widespread belief in reincarnation is not an original Buddhist tenet. Evola presents actual practices of concentration and visualization, and places them in the larger metaphysical context of the Buddhist model of mind and universe. <br><i>The Doctrine of the Awakening</i> is a provocative study of the teachings of the Buddha by one of Europe's most stimulating thinkers.</p><p>A controversial philosopher and critic of modern Western civilization, Julius Evola (1898-1974) wrote widely on Eastern religions, alchemy, sexuality, politics, and mythology.

Raised in the London of the late 1400's, Thomas was a bright student eager for knowledge. When serving as a page for Cardinal Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury noticed his bright wit and sent him to Oxford. There young Thomas became a scholar and later one of the greatest lawyers in England. Going on to serve his King, he soon became one of Henry VIII's most trusted advisors. But then the unthinkable happened.</p><p>King Henry VIII defied Rome and set himself up as the head of the Church in England, commanding all of his subjects to acknowledge him as such.

Showing deeply personal interior spaces, often illuminated by the lush natural light of the artist&#x2019;s studio in New York City&#x2019;s East Village, these black-and-white images reveal a unique type of collaboration between Leiter and his subjects. In the 1970s Leiter planned to make a book of nudes, but the project was never realized in his lifetime. Now, we get a first-time look at this body of work, which was begun on Leiter&#x2019;s arrival in New York in 1946 and honed over the next two decades. Leiter, who was also a painter, allows abstract elements into the photographs and often shows the influence of his favorite artists, including Bonnard, Vuillard and Matisse. Leiter, who painted and took pictures prolifically up to his death, worked in relative obscurity until he entered his eighties. He preferred to be left alone, and resisted any type of explanation or analysis of his work. With <i>In My Room</i>, Leiter ushers viewers into his private world while retaining his strong sense of mystery. <br><b>Saul Leiter</b> was born in Pittsburgh in 1923. In 1946 he moved to New York to become a painter, but was encouraged to pursue photography by the photographic experimentation and influence of his friend, the Abstract Expressionist Richard Pousette-Dart. Leiter subsequently enjoyed a successful career as a fashion photographer spanning three decades, and his images were published in magazines such as <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>, <i>Elle</i> and <i>British Vogue</i>. His work is held in many prestigious private and public collections, including The Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Leiter died in November 2013.</p><p>These quiet, intimate black-and-white photographs, which Leiter developed himself in his darkroom, were kept under lock and key during his lifetime; only a few friends knew them. His female models were friends or lovers whom the artist portrayed in the everyday setting of his New York apartment; they were not professional nude models. As if in an act of conspiracy, they joined the photographer in playful collaboration to challenge the dualistic principle of voyeurism and exhibitionism. (<i>Eye of Photography</i>)<br><br>The images are lovingly and expertly reproduced in a broad dynamic range from delicate gray tones to rich blacks, and is beautifully printed on heavy matte paper by master printer Steidl. (Richard Rivera <i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>The book is an homage and a love letter. (Vince Aletti <i>Photograph</i>)<br><br>The great photographer captured thousands of unguarded moments in his New York studio, finding beauty in surprising places. (<i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>It is the clear sense of collaboration between subject and artist that makes these images so striking. (Daisy Woodward <i>AnOther Magazine</i>)</p><h2>What Stars Are Made Of: The Life of Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</h2><p><p><b>The history of science is replete with women getting little notice for their groundbreaking discoveries. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, a tireless innovator who correctly theorized the substance of stars, was one of them.</b></p><p>It was not easy being a woman of ambition in early twentieth-century England, much less one who wished to be a scientist. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin overcame prodigious obstacles to become a woman of many firsts: the first to receive a PhD in astronomy from Radcliffe College, the first promoted to full professor at Harvard, the first to head a department there. And, in what has been called &#x201c;the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy,&#x201d; she was the first to describe what stars are made of.</p><p>Payne lived in a society that did not know what to make of a determined schoolgirl who wanted to know everything. She was derided in college and refused a degree. As a graduate student, she faced formidable skepticism. Revolutionary ideas rarely enjoy instantaneous acceptance, but the learned men of the astronomical community found hers especially hard to take seriously. Though welcomed at the Harvard College Observatory, she worked for years without recognition or status. Still, she accomplished what every scientist yearns for: discovery. She calculated the atomic composition of stars&#x2015;only to be told that her conclusions were wrong by the very man who would later show her to be correct.</p><p>In <i>What Stars Are Made Of,</i> Donovan Moore brings this remarkable woman to life through extensive archival research, family interviews, and photographs. Moore retraces Payne&#x2019;s steps with visits to cramped observatories and nighttime bicycle rides through the streets of Cambridge, England. The result is a story of devotion and tenacity that speaks powerfully to our own time.</p></p><p><p>Donovan Moore has written for numerous newspapers and magazines, including the <i>Boston Globe</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and has worked as a television reporter and producer.</p></p><h2>Photographic Atlas of Entomology &amp; Guide to Insect Identification</h2><p>Seventh Printing. Written by James L. Castner. 2000. Feline Press, Inc. A learning aid created especially with entomology students in mind and designed for use in the laboratories of General Entomology and Insect Taxonomy courses. Features more than 600 color photos that illustrate the structural characters and anatomical features of the major insect families and arthropod groups discussed in entomology courses. Photographs cover some 190 arthropod taxa (including 30 insect and 8 arachnid orders), accompanied by explanations and illustrations of external anatomy and insect development. Dichotomous keys to the family level are included for the major orders, as well as a glossary of specialized terms. 8-1/2&#34; x 11&#34;. Spiral-bound. 174 Pages.</p><p>Although photo atlases in other fields of the life sciences have long been available to aid students in their studies, there has never been one for entomology. One reason for this is the great number of photos necessary for such a book to be of any value. Fortunately for students, Dr. Castner has spent the past 25 years photographing insects with his work appearing in everything from National Geographic to Ranger Rick. Dr. Castner&#39;s experience in teaching and working with students has allowed him to produce a work that exactly addresses their needs. His Photographic Atlas of Entomology is simple, thorough, user-friendly, and very reasonably priced. It should be a great help to any entomology student, as well as to the professors teaching entomology courses.I can't tell you how many times I have seen students sitting in the hallway outside the entomology lab, frantically trying to study in the last few minutes before a quiz or lab practical. These and other students deserve something better than a bunch of pages of hastily scrawled notes from which to study. The purpose of this photo atlas is NOT to take the place of students examining actual specimens in a collection. The purpose is to make it easier for them to study such specimens, and to review these studies in a more meaningful way outside the lab by having photographs of representative insects to guide them. <p>I have set what I feel is a low price ($35) on this book in order to make it affordable to all students. However, with 670 color images included, printing costs were high. I will listen to feedback from both students and professors, and will try to incorporate changes that will improve this text in future additions. It is my sincere hope that both students and teachers will find this book helpful with the result that entomology becomes more fun.</p></p><h2>An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States</h2><p>In this famous study, the author turned the hagiography of many earlier American historians on its head. Unlike those writers, who had stressed idealistic impulses as factors determining the structure of the American government, Beard questioned the Founding Fathers' motivations in drafting the Constitution and viewed the results as a product of economic self-interest.<br>Brimming with human interest, insights, and information every student of American history will prize, this volume &#x2014; one of the most controversial books of its time &#x2014; continues to prompt new perceptions of the supreme law of the land.<br>"A staple for history and economics collections." &#x2014; <i>Library Journal.<br></i>"Replete with human interest and compact with information of importance to every student of American history or of political science." &#x2014; <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.</i></p><p><p> <em>Louis Filler</em> (1911-1998) was a Fulbright fellow at the University of Bristol and taught as a visiting professor in literature and history departments from the City University of New York to the University of California, San Francisco.

Beard</em> (1874-1948) is regarded as one of the most influential American historians in the first half of the twentieth century. He is famous for his evaluation of the founding fathers of the United States, who he believed were motivated by economics as opposed to philosophical principles. Some of his works include <em>An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy</em>, and <em>The Administration and Politics of Tokyo.</em></p>"Here again is the original constitutional skeptic to remind Americans that our republic's authors had not only intellects but interests. Charles Beard set out to jolt his contemporaries out of their pious admiration of the constitution's framers. His economic interpretation remains a lively, surprisingly humorous and sharp-witted analysis of the nation's beginnings. Reading it today, the book aims a keen and pointed thrust at the originalism of our own age." (Professor Eric Rauchway, University of California Davis Department of History)<br><br>"One hundred years after it first appeared, Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution still commands our attention as a classic of historical scholarship -- not because every view Beard put forward has stood the test of time but because the questions he raised about the intersections of economic and political power are just as relevant today as when he wrote." (Professor Eric Foner, Columbia University Department of History)<br><br>"This is the book that started us all on the journey to understanding the complex motives and conflicting interests that shaped our constitution. 100 years after its publication, it still has the power to excite and exasperate, to stir fierce debate and to inspire new interpretations."

Now she returns to delight a new generation in this carefully produced reissue, which restores the book to its original appearance. <br> All the original stories are here, as Raggedy Ann comes to Marcella's nursery and quickly becomes the leader of the dolls. After learning a lesson from a naughty raid on the pantry, Raggedy Ann's adventures show her striving to be good -- and succeeding. She and the other dolls rescue Fido, the family dog, from the dogcatcher. When, in one adventure, Raggedy Ann has to have her stuffing replaced, she gets her famous "I LOVE YOU" candy heart. Raggedy Ann also goes up in a kite, teaches two new dolls to be tolerant, and shares the excitement of a baby brother for Marcella, among several other tales. <br> Johnny Gruelle's delicate illustrations are the perfect companions to the well-loved stories in this American classic, the only edition authorized by the Gruelle family. A brief biography of the author-artist by his grandson, Kim Gruelle, makes this edition especially valuable.</p><p>Raggedy Ann has been entertaining and charming young readers ever since the first book created by Johnny Gruelle in 1918 chronicled the adventures of the mischievous rag doll and her delightful toy friends. Gruelle's inspiration was a real doll?a doll made for his mother by his grandmother and then much loved by his daughter Marcella. <i>Raggedy Ann Stories</i>, Gruelle's first collection of tales, was soon followed by books that introduced Raggedy Andy and the fairyland called the Deep, Deep Woods.<br>In this edition of <i>The Raggedy Ann Stories,</i> which contains the best original tales and artwork, you'll meet the rag doll's toy friends, as well as Fido the dog and Marcella, the little girl in whose house there is a special room where Raggedy Ann and all the other dolls live. Often, by the end of a story, after an exciting adventure or, perhaps, a wonderful journey, Raggedy Ann and her friends have learned a small but valuable lesson of life.<br>From the days of her discovery by the real Marcella, the little rag doll with the red-yarn hair has inspired timeless tales and colorful pictures and has stirred the imaginations of millions of young readers all over the world.Johnny Gruelle was an extremely talented cartoonist, illustrator, and storyteller. He had already written and illustrated a book of original fairy tales before creating the Raggedy Ann and Andy stories. Raggedy Ann, heroine of the first book, was a favorite doll of his daughter, Marcella, who died after a long illness at the age of thirteen. Johnny Gruelle eventually created over forty Raggedy Ann and Andy books, all capturing his unique version of childhood.</p><h2>Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective</h2><p><p>How did the rich countries really become rich?&nbsp; In this provocative study, Ha-Joon Chang examines the great pressure on developing countries from the developed world to adopt certain 'good policies' and 'good institutions', seen today as necessary for economic development.

It was a bowdlerized edition: Darwin's family, attempting to protect his posthumous reputation, had deleted all the passages they considered too personal or controversial. The present complete edition did not appear until 1959, one hundred years after the publication of <em>The Origin of Species</em>. Upon its appearance, Loren Eiseley wrote:<br><br> "No man can pretend to know Darwin who does not know his autobiography. Here, for the first time since his death, it is presented complete and unexpurgated, as it exists in the family archives. It will prove invaluable to biographers and cast new light on the personality of one of the world's greatest scientists. Nora Barlow, Darwin's granddaughter, has proved herself a superb editor. Her own annotations make fascinating reading."<br><br> The daring and restless mind, the integrity and simplicity of Darwin's character are revealed in this direct and personal account of his life&#x2015;his family, his education, his explorations of the natural world, his religion and philosophy. The editor has provided page and line references to the more important restored passages, and previously unpublished notes and letters on family matters and on the controversy between Samuel Butler appear in an appendix.<br></p><p>Naturalist <strong>Charles Darwin</strong> (1809-1882) is the father of evolution. His groundbreaking <em>The Origin of Species</em> argued that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and proposed the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection.

Suddenly, she is surrounded by male admirers, all expecting her to marry them. But before she marries anyone, Rose is determined to establish herself as an independent young woman. Besides, she suspects that some of her friends like her more her money than for herself. How can Rose tell who her real friends are? Is there anyone she can count on?</p><p><p>Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, and began her writing career at an early age, with short stories for newspapers and magazines. What began as a series of stories in the 1860s&nbsp;became the classic American children's novel we know today as&nbsp;<i>Little Women</i>.</p>Grade 7 Up-Although Louisa May Alcott is best known for classics such as Little Women and Little Men, Rose in Bloom also boasts a lively cast of characters growing up with 19th century social conventions and expectations. A sequel to Eight Cousins, this story finds 20-year-old Rose, the only female cousin, coping with the demands of being an eligible heiress, and her feelings about her widely diverse boy cousins. Blessed with common sense and compassion, Rose and her adopted sister, Phoebe, mature through loss, hard choices, and finally end up with the men that complete them. Barbara Caruso's considerable narration skills are apparent as she conveys exuberance, prim respectability, and sadness. The sound quality is good. Smaller libraries may have to pass on this pleasant addition to their Alcott works in audio format, but public and school libraries that do purchase Rose in Bloom will find it's a refreshing rendition of a lesser known classic.<br><i>Barbara Wysocki, Cora J.

She lives in New York City.</p>*Starred Review* Gr. 3-5. Like Katrina Saltonstall Currier's <i>Kai's Journey to Gold Mountain </i>(2005), this poignant picture book is about a Chinese immigrant boy trying to join his father^B in America. But this story is much more detailed, with a lengthy text that describes leaving the old country as well as the difficulties of getting into the new one. Drawing on her father-in-law's experience, Lee tells of Sun, 12, whose family employs a tutor to help prepare him for American officials' questions. Sun must memorize minute details about his home in China to prove that he is his father's true son. Indeed, Sun is detained on Angel Island, where he is interrogated for a month, and where he makes friends with two "paper sons," who have made up identities to get into the country. The story is told with quiet restraint; there are no emotional partings from Sun's mother in China, no tearful reunions with older brothers already in California. But the tension is always there, and Choi's beautiful, full-page oil paintings, in sepia tones and shades of green, are quiet and packed with feeling--especially evident when the boy, stripped to the waist, endures the humiliating medical exam and when, dressed in suit and tie, he faces his interrogators, trying to remember his story. Pair this with Lawrence Yep's <i>Tongues of Jade</i> (1991) and other stories of immigrants detained on Ellis Island, terrified of being sent back. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Gray ash, blown into ripples, exposed an old campfire ring. On the edges of the clearing the ash melded into gray hills, low and still in death. Black spikes, the last rebellion of living trees, thrust up through the misery of destruction. <br>Giving God the finger, Charles thought. Never a good idea. Like most Catholics, Charles prayed to Jesus and Mother Mary when he bothered to pray. Jesus was in the redemption business. Not God; God was in the smiting business. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re we gonna do, Dude?&#x201d; <br>Charles slid his eyes toward the Fox River. The fire had been stopped by the water. Its final act of destruction was the campground. On the far bank, vegetation was a lush mockery; verdant greens, rich golds, and loud reds thrust out over the water like so many jeering faces. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re we gonna do, Dude?&#x201d; repeated the goon, slouching between Charles and the river. <br>Known facts automatically played in Charles&#x2019;s mind: Sean Ferris, small-time muscle. Philadelphia, Chicago, then Detroit. Served three years for rape. Obedient, loyal. Attack dog. Ferris was old for this work, and fat. The black leather coat and pointed-toe boots stuck him in the sixties, too overdone even to pass for retro. <br>Charles took his cell phone from the pocket of the blanket coat and pushed the number three. <br>&#x201c;Calling Mr. Big?&#x201d; asked another of the goons Bernie had stuck him with. <br>James R. Spinks, forty-one years of age, out of Detroit, Michigan, connected to what passed for Mafia. Scum for hire. IQ of 84. Went by the name Jimmy. Grown men who liked to be called by little boys&#x2019; names needed to be hung by their tiny dicks, Charles thought. <br>Bernie picked up on the second ring. The fool must be hunched over the phone, waiting for news of his cunning foray into crime. <br>&#x201c;Campground is burned,&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;Nothing to acquire.&#x201d; The job was supposed to be a clean smash-and-grab. Bernie, <i>Mr. Big,</i> hadn&#x2019;t done his homework. The fool actually believed Charles had no idea who was the so-called brains behind this caper. Bernard Iverson, forty-six, Edmondson, Canada, marine equipment, massively overextended, net worth five million dollars and still not worth the bullet it would take to kill him. <br>&#x201c;One second, please,&#x201d; Bernie said. <br>Unblinking, Charles waited, listening to a clatter that suggested Bernie was using his cell phone as a hockey puck. He gritted his teeth, his jaw muscles bunched into hard knots. This was the only outward show of emotion he allowed himself. Humans were masters at reading faces. A second&#x2019;s hesitation, a flick of the eyes, a smile at the wrong time telegraphed weakness. Even people who didn&#x2019;t understand what they were seeing retained enough feral instinct to home in on any chink in the armor. From that day forth they hammered at it until the chink became a crack and the crack a break. Once the soft flesh was exposed they went for the entrails with talons and tongues as sharp as harpies&#x2019;. <br>The only earth the meek inherited was six feet down and capped by a stone. <br>A final scrimmage and Bernie was back. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a second campsite about four miles north on the same side of the river. It looks like it didn&#x2019;t burn. They probably stopped there.&#x201d; <br>Charles kept waiting. Four miles, no trail, probably: not good enough. The whole setup was Mickey Mouse. Bernie didn&#x2019;t know Charles, but Charles knew him. Michael had once said the so-called <i>Mr. Big</i> was nickel and dime, undermining unions, cutting corners, slighting on materials. That was why they&#x2019;d bought him out. When it came to fundamental criminal activities, Charles doubted if he could steal a peek at a nudist camp. Given half a day, Charles could have come up with a better crew than Bernie&#x2019;s bottom-feeders. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a bird&#x2019;s-eye&#x2019;s and call you back,&#x201d; Bernie said finally. <br>Charles punched the disconnect. Jimmy, dressed in a coat identical to the one Charles wore, but with a matching hat and earflaps, spit a stream of tobacco juice into the ash. Mostly into the ash; a drop or two of spittle remained in the Ted Kaczynski&#x2013;style beard he sported. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the deal?&#x201d; Jimmy asked. His teeth were stained brown. <br>Charles looked away. &#x201c;The target may be four miles upriver. The pilot&#x2019;s doing a flyby. We wait here until we have a positive ID.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d; This from Reg. <br>Reginald Waters, African American, thirty-one, Detroit. Ex-gangbanger, low-end drug dealer, con man. Into bookies for a hundred and seventy-three grand. Last call for repayment before the bad boys came for him. <br>&#x201c;If the target is located, we move to acquire it,&#x201d; Charles said without looking at Waters. Eye contact was an invitation to intimacy. Flee, fight, fornicate, or, Charles&#x2019;s least favorite, ask stupid questions. Open honest intercourse was not a paradigm for leadership that appealed to him. <br>&#x201c;Even with others he works alone.&#x201d; <br>Charles&#x2019;s brother had said that. A photograph of Michael clicked onto the screen in Charles&#x2019;s mind, the black-and-white glossy taken for his senior yearbook. Next to it appeared the picture of the target lifted from the Internet. <br>Payback is going to be a bitch, Charles promised his little brother. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Nevada Barr <br></p><h2>The Red Door: An Inspector Rutledge Mystery (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries, 12)</h2><p><p> At the end of a terrible war, a woman painted the door to her house red to welcome her husband home from the Front . . . but he never returned.

Many have a general sense that the "system" is in disorder -- if not on the road to functional collapse. But though it is easy to identify our political problems, the solutions are not always as clear. In <i>Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries</i>, bestselling author Naomi Wolf illustrates the breathtaking changes that can take place when ordinary citizens engage in the democratic system the way the founders intended and tells how to use that system, right now, to change your life, your community, and ultimately, the nation.</p><p><b>Naomi Wolf</b> made a sensation with her landmark international bestseller <i>The Beauty Myth</i> in 1991. The author of four books, she is also the cofounder and president of the Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership. She lives in New York City.<b>Introduction</b><p>The summer before last, I traveled across the country talking about threats to our liberty. I spoke and listened to groups of Americans from all walks of life. They told me new and always harsher stories of state coercion.</p><p>What I had called a "fascist shift" in the United States, projections I had warned about as worst-case scenarios, was now surpassing my imagination: in 2008, thousands of terrified, shackled illegal immigrants were rounded up in the mass arrests which always characterize a closing society;1 news emerged that the 9/11 report had been based on evidence derived from the testimonies of prisoners who had been tortured -- and the tapes that documented their torture were missing -- leading the commissioners of the report publicly to disavow their own findings;2 the Associated Press reported that the torture of prisoners in U.S.-held facilities had not been the work of "a few bad apples" but had been directed out of the White House;3 the TSA "watch list," which had contained 45,000 names when I wrote my last book, ballooned to 755,000 names and 20,000 were being added every month;4 Scott McClellan confirmed that the drive to war in Iraq had been based on administration lies;5 HR 1955, legislation that would criminalize certain kinds of political thought and speech, passed the House and made it to the Senate;6 Blackwater, a violent paramilitary force not answerable to the people, established presences in Illinois and North Carolina and sought to get into border patrol activity in San Diego.7</p><p>The White House has established, no matter who leads the nation in the future, U.S. government spying on the emails and phone calls of Americans -- a permanent violation of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.8 The last step of the ten steps to a closed society is the subversion of the rule of law. That is happening now. What critics have called a "paper coup" has already taken place.</p><p>Yes, the situation is dire. But history shows that when an army of citizens, supported by even a vestige of civil society, believes in liberty -- in the psychological space that is "America" -- no power on earth can ultimately suppress them.</p><p>Dissident Natan Sharansky writes that there are two kinds of states -- "fear societies" and "free societies."9 Understood in this light, "America" -- the state of freedom that is under attack -- is first of all a place in the mind. That is what we must regain now to fight back.</p><p>The two societies make up two kinds of consciousness. The consciousness derived of oppression is despairing, fatalistic, and fearful of inquiry. It is mistrustful of the self and forced to trust external authority. It is premised on a dearth of self-respect. It is cramped. People around the world understand that this kind of inner experience is as toxic an environment as is a polluted waterway they are forced to drink from; it is as insufficient a space as being compelled to sleep in a one-room hut with seven other bodies on the floor.</p><p>In contrast, the consciousness of freedom -- the psychology of freedom that is "America" -- is one of expansiveness, trust of the self, and hope. It is a consciousness of limitless inquiry. "Everything," wrote Denis Diderot, who influenced, via Thomas Jefferson, the Revolutionary generation, "must be examined, everything must be shaken up, without exception and without circumspection."10 Jefferson wrote that American universities are "based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it."11 Since this state of mind is self-trusting, it builds up in a citizen a wealth of self-respect. "Your own reason," wrote Jefferson to his nephew, "is the only oracle given you by heaven, and you are answerable not for the rightness but the uprightness of the decision."12</p><p>After my cross-country journey, I realized that I needed to go back and read about the original Revolutionaries of our nation. I realized in a new way from them that liberty is not a set of laws or a system of government; it is not a nation or a species of patriotism. Liberty is a state of mind before it is anything else. You can have a nation of wealth and power, but without this state of mind -- this psychological "America" -- you are living in a deadening consciousness; with this state of mind, you can be in a darkened cell waiting for your torturer to arrive and yet inhabit a chainless space as wide as the sky.</p><p>"America," too, is a state of mind. "Being an American" is a set of attitudes and actions, not a nationality or a posture of reflexive loyalty. This tribe of true "Americans" consists of people who have crossed a personal Rubicon of a specific kind and can no longer be satisfied with anything less than absolute liberty.</p><p>This state of mind, I learned, has no national boundaries. The Tibetans, who, as I write this, are marching in the face of Chinese soldiers, are acting like members of this tribe; so did the Pakistani lawyers who recently faced down house arrest and tear gas in their suits and judicial robes. Nathan Hale, Patrick Henry, and Ida B. Wells, who risked their lives for liberty, acted like "Americans." When the crusading journalist Anna Politkovskaya insisted on reporting on war crimes in Chechnya, even though her informing her fellow citizens led -- as she knew it well could -- to her being gunned down on her doorstep as she went home to her fourteen-year-old daughter, she was acting like an American.13 When three JAG lawyers refused to sell out their detainee clients, they were being "Americans." When Vietnam vet David Antoon risked his career to speak out in favor of the Constitution's separation of church and state, he was being an "American." When journalist Josh Wolf went to jail rather than reveal a source, he was being an "American" too. Always, everywhere, the members of this tribe are fundamentally the same, in spite of the great deal that may divide them in terms of clothing and religion, language and culture. But when we quietly go about our business as our rights are plundered, when we yield to passivity and switch on the Wii and hand over our power to a leadership class that has no interest in our voice, we are not acting like true Americans. Indeed, at those moments we are essentially giving up our citizenship.</p><p>The notion that "American-ness" is a state of mind -- a rigorous psychodynamic process or a continued personal challenge, rather than a static point on a map or an impressive display in a Fourth of July parade -- is not new. But we are so used to being raised on a rhetoric of cheap patriotism -- the kind that you get to tune in to in a feel-good way just because you were lucky enough to have been born here and can then pretty much forget about -- that this definition seems positively exotic. The founders understood "American-ness" in this way, though, not at all in our way.</p><p>And today, I learned as I traveled, we are very far from experiencing this connection to our source. Many of us feel ourselves clouded within, cramped, baffled obscurely from without, not in alignment with the electric source that is liberty. So it is easy for us to rationalize always further and more aggressive cramping and clouding; is the government spying on us? Well...Okay...So now the telecommunications companies are asking for retroactive immunity for their spying on us? Well...Okay...Once a certain threshold of passivity has been crossed, it becomes easier and easier, as Benjamin Franklin warned, to trade liberty for a false security -- and deserve neither.</p><p>What struck me on my journey was how powerless so many Americans felt to make change. Many citizens I heard from felt more hopeless than did citizens of some of the poorest and youngest democracies on the planet. Others were angrier than ever and were speaking up and acting up with fervor. I felt that all of us -- the hopeless and the hopeful -- needed to reconnect to our mentors, the founders, and to remind ourselves of the blueprint for freedom they meant us to inherit. I wrote this handbook with the faith that if Americans take personal ownership of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they can push back any darkness. The first two sections of this refresher guide to our liberties recall what America is supposed to be; the last third is a practical how-to for citizen leadership for a new American Revolution.</p><p>There are concrete laws we must pass to restore liberty and actions we must take to safeguard it. You will find them in the last third of this handbook. But more crucial than any list of laws or actions is our own need to rediscover our role as American revolutionaries and to reclaim the "America" in ourselves -- in our consciousness as free men and women.</p><p>Do we have the right to see ourselves this way? Absolutely. Many histories of our nation's founding focus on a small group, "a band of brothers" or "the Founding Fathers" -- the handful of illustrious men whose names we all know. This tight focus tends to reinforce the idea that we are the lucky recipients of the American gift of liberty and of the republic, not ourselves its stewards, crafters, and defenders. It prepares us to think of ourselves as the led, not as the leaders.</p><p>But historians are also now documenting the stories of how in the pre-Revolutionary years, ordinary people -- farmers, free and enslaved Africans, washer-women, butchers, printers, apprentices, carpenters, penniless soldiers, artisans, wheelwrights, teachers, indentured servants -- were rising up against the king's representatives, debating the nature of liberty, fighting the war and following the warriors to support them, insisting on expanding the franchise, demanding the right to vote, compelling the more aristocratic leaders of the community to include them in deliberations about the nature of the state constitutions, and requiring transparency and accountability in the legislative process.14 Even enslaved Africans, those Americans most silenced by history, were not only debating in their own communities the implications or the ideas of God-given liberty that t...</p></p><h2>Desert God: A Novel of Ancient Egypt</h2><p><p>Game of Thrones meets ancient Egypt in this magnificent epic from one of the world&#x2019;s biggest-selling authors&#x2014;a novel that conjures the magic, mystery, romance, and bloody intrigue of a fascinating lost world . . .</p><p>On the gleaming banks of the Nile, the brilliant Taita&#x2014;slave and advisor to the Pharaoh&#x2014;finds himself at the center of a vortex of passion, intrigue, and danger.

But things changed dramatically when he began suffering from inexplicable fatigue. In a matter of weeks, his organs were failing and he was read his last rites. Doctors were baffled by his condition, which they had yet to even diagnose. Floating in and out of consciousness, Fajgenbaum prayed for the equivalent of a game day overtime: a second chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Miraculously, Fajgenbaum survived&#x2014;only to endure repeated near-death relapses from what would eventually be identified as a form of Castleman disease, an extremely deadly and rare condition that acts like a cross between cancer and an autoimmune disorder. When he relapsed while on the only drug in development and realized that the medical community was unlikely to make progress in time to save his life, Fajgenbaum turned his desperate hope for a cure into concrete action: Between hospitalizations he studied his own charts and tested his own blood samples, looking for clues that could unlock a new treatment. With the help of family, friends, and mentors, he also reached out to other Castleman disease patients and physicians, and eventually came up with an ambitious plan to crowdsource the most promising research questions and recruit world-class researchers to tackle them. Instead of waiting for the scientific stars to align, he would attempt to align them himself.<br>&nbsp;<br>More than five years later and now married to his college sweetheart, Fajgenbaum has seen his hard work pay off: A treatment that he identified has induced a tentative remission and his novel approach to collaborative scientific inquiry has become a blueprint for advancing rare disease research. His incredible story demonstrates the potency of hope, and what can happen when the forces of determination, love, family, faith, and serendipity collide.<br><br><b>&#x201c;A page-turning chronicle of living, nearly dying, and discovering what it really means to be invincible in hope.&#x201d;&#x2014;Angela Duckworth, #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Grit</i></b></p><p><b>David Fajgenbaum</b>, MD, MBA, MSc, is a graduate of Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Wharton School.

The life has already been lost. But hope hasn&#x2019;t been, not necessarily. You could keep that alive at least. You could keep doing compressions until your arms and shoulders are too worn out to continue, until you can&#x2019;t push hard enough to make a difference, much less break another rib. <br><br>So&#x2014;how long do you try to bring someone back? <br><br>Eventually you will remove your hands from the body, eventually you&#x2019;ll have to&#x2014;but <i>eventually</i> isn&#x2019;t a number. It isn&#x2019;t guidance. You won&#x2019;t see it in a CPR diagram. And it doesn&#x2019;t even really answer &#x201c;when&#x201d; so much as &#x201c;why.&#x201d; When you <i>eventually</i> stop, you stop because there&#x2019;s no more hope. That&#x2019;s what makes the decision so difficult. Your effort allows you to hope that life is possible, and your hope inspires you to push even harder. The three of those things&#x2014;hope, life, and effort&#x2014;chase one another, keep one another moving around a track. <br><br>I have performed CPR twice in my life. Both times, the patients were nearly dead when I began my relentless chest compressions and prayers. And both ended up dying. I didn&#x2019;t want to stop. I wish I was still going right now. And I continued to hope that I&#x2019;d see a pulse appear on the heart monitor even after I had stopped my chest compressions. But hoping and wishing are often not enough. Hope can be a force; but it isn&#x2019;t a superpower. Neither is any part of medicine, much as we&#x2019;d like it to be. <br><br>It can feel like one, though. <br><br>When I set out to be a doctor, I had already borne witness to incurable disease and inconsolable sadness&#x2014;my mother had died of brain cancer when I was in college&#x2014;but I was still optimistic about the power of science and medicine to find answers and cures. Because to be honest, long after I could reasonably blame it on youth and na�vet�, I basically believed in the Santa Claus theory of civilization: that for every problem in the world, there are surely people working diligently&#x2014;in workshops near and far, with powers both practical and magical&#x2014;to solve it. Or perhaps they&#x2019;ve already solved it. <br><br>That faith has perverse effects, especially in medicine. Believing that nearly all medical questions are already answered means that all you need to do is find a doctor who knows the answers. And as long as Santa-doctors are working diligently on those diseases for which there are not yet answers, there is no incentive for us to try to push forward progress for these diseases when they affect us or our loved ones. <br><br>I know better now. I&#x2019;ve had a lot of time over the past few years to think about doctors, and they&#x2019;ve had a lot of time to think about me. One thing I&#x2019;ve learned is that every one of us who puts on a white coat has a fraught relationship with the concept of <i>authority</i>. Of course, we all train and grind for years and years to <i>have</i> it. We all <i>want</i> it. And we all seek to be the trusted voice in the room when someone else is full of urgent questions. And the public expects near omniscience from physicians. But at the same time, all of that education, all those books, all those clinical rotations, all of it instills in us a kind of realism about what is and what is not ultimately possible. Not one of us knows all there is to know. Not even nearly. We may perform masterfully from time to time&#x2014;and a select few may really be masterful at particular specialties&#x2014;but by and large we accept our limits. It&#x2019;s not easy. Because beyond those limits are mirages of omnipotence that torture us: a life we could have saved, a cure we could have found. A drug. A diagnosis. A firm answer. <br><br>The truth is that no one knows everything, but that&#x2019;s not really the problem. The problem is that, for some things, no one knows <i>anything</i>, <i>nothing</i> is being done to change that, and sometimes medicine can be frankly wrong. <br><br>I still believe in the power of science and medicine. And I still believe in the importance of hard work and kindness. And I am still hopeful. And I still pray. But my adventures as both a doctor and a patient have taught me volumes about the often unfair disconnect between the best that science can offer and our fragile longevity, between thoughts and prayers and health and well-being. <br><br>This is a story about how I found out that Santa&#x2019;s proxies in medicine didn&#x2019;t exist, they weren&#x2019;t working on my gift, and they wouldn&#x2019;t be delivering me a cure. It&#x2019;s also a story about how I came to understand that hope cannot be a passive concept. It&#x2019;s a choice and a force; hoping for something takes more than casting out a wish to the universe and waiting for it to occur. Hope should inspire action. And when it does inspire action in medicine and science, that hope can become a reality, beyond your wildest dreams. <br><br>In essence, this is a story about dying, from which I hope you can learn about living.</p><h2>The Biophilia Effect: A Scientific and Spiritual Exploration of the Healing Bond Between Humans and Nature</h2><p><p>Did you know that spending time in a forest activates the vagus nerve, which is responsible for inducing calm and regeneration?

Returning changed how the past and future seemed. I felt compelled to write about it. Three years later I completed the book and emerged from that long period of concentrated work blinking into the light. It was then that I decided to go to Siena. I have for a long time been interested in Sienese art. But, now that I was finally going, my mind began to devise ways of delaying my arrival. It was as though the long years of anticipation had created a reticence. And so I complicated how I was to get there. As Siena does not have an airport, I considered flying to Florence and walking the 80 kilometers or so across the Chianti hills. I convinced myself of this on the grounds that I liked the idea of small steps covering a long distance and of finally entering the city on foot. But, a week before I was due to depart, I had, in an embarrassingly undramatic accident&#x2014;in fact, by simply turning direction&#x2014;twisted my knee. The pain was tremendous. When I asked the doctor how I could cause such damage by doing so little, he looked at me and said, &#x201c;It happens.&#x201d; He then told me that I should definitely not undertake any long-distance walks. I regretted booking the flat in Siena. I had found it after only fifteen minutes of searching online and had already paid the deposit.<br><br>My knee had not fully recovered, but I made up my mind nonetheless to fly on the planned date. My wife, Diana, decided to join me for a couple of days. She was, in effect, delivering me there. She seemed to know better than I did my need for this trip. The only tickets we could find were on Swissair. I was born in 1970 and, even though we lived in Tripoli, most of the travel my parents did throughout my childhood was on that airline. I still associate it with adventure and reliability. But on our second leg, flying from Zurich to Florence, and just as we were crossing over the snow-capped Alps, with their dramatic ravines gashed deeper where the narrow streams of melted snow ran black, the airplane suddenly turned full circle and began traveling in the opposite direction. A few minutes later the captain spoke. He said that due to a mechanical fault we had to return to Zurich. No further explanation was offered. I calculated that it would have taken us forty minutes to reach Florence and now it would take about half an hour to return to Zurich. What could have possibly gone wrong for the plane to be judged unfit to fly that extra ten minutes? Diana held my hand. I made some joke about how nice it would be to spend a few days in the Alps. She smiled cautiously and remained quiet. The plane was full and when it suddenly shook a little, some passengers could not help but let out a shallow murmur of panic. I heard a woman cry. Otherwise, everyone remained still and silent. I remember thinking I did not mind dying&#x2014;that it would have to come at some point&#x2014;but that I was not quite ready yet, that dying now would be a waste, given how much time I had spent learning how to live.<br><br>When the plane landed in Zurich, several of the passengers clapped. Diana and I had a tasteless lunch in the airport. The following flight did not get us into Florence till night. We went into town and had a drink and a bite to eat. We managed to make the last bus to Siena. We laughed about the saga, about how it had taken us as long to get from London to Florence as it would take to fly to India. The bus moved in the dark. It began to rain, and the rain turned monstrously beautiful, lashing the windows. In one of the curves the driver swerved violently and parked by the wayside, where he had spotted another bus that had broken down. The driver of the bus stood by the side of the road waving a torch toward us. Behind him men, women and children clustered under their umbrellas, their suitcases beside them. The drivers exchanged some words and some of the passengers from the broken-down bus began to climb on to our bus. As there were hardly any free seats left, they filled the aisle. Their clothes smelled musty and sweet from the rain. Several of us gave up our seats to the elderly. Then a loud argument ensued between the drivers: our bus could not hold any more passengers, and the driver of the other bus should have been more careful. When we resumed our journey, I saw that the front of the broken-down bus had completely plugged itself into the thick steel barrier that stood between the road and the drop. With every turn, we, the standing passengers, swayed back and forth as if performing a mournful dance routine.<br><br>At this point the whole trip seemed a terribly bad idea. Why had I been so determined to come? In 1990, when I was nineteen and still at university in London, I had become mysteriously fascinated by the Sienese School of painting, which covered the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. I had lost my father that year. He had been living in exile in Cairo, and one afternoon he was kidnapped, bundled into an unmarked airplane and flown back to Libya. He was imprisoned and gradually, like salt dissolving in water, was made to vanish. It was shortly after this that, for reasons that still remain unclear to me now, I began to visit the National Gallery in London every day during my lunch break and would stand in front of one painting for most of the hour. Every week I would choose a different picture. Today, more than a quarter of a century later, having failed to find any trace of my father, I continue to look at paintings in this way, one at a time. I have found much profit in it. A picture changes as you look at it and changes in ways that are unexpected. I have discovered that a painting requires time. Now it takes me several months and more often than not a year before I can move on. During that period the picture becomes a mental as well as a physical location in my life.<br><br>I was in the early stages of this habit when I encountered the Sienese paintings. At first I did not know how to approach them. They seemed, in their often symmetrical structure and direct gaze, to be an affront, a confrontation. They were foreign in ways that the other pictures I was interested in then&#x2014;paintings by artists such as Vel�zquez, Manet, Titian, C�zanne and Canaletto&#x2014;were not. These pictures from the Sienese School seemed instead to belong to a cloistered world of Christian codes and symbolism. I cannot say that they gave me pleasure. Yet I kept, almost against my own intentions, returning to them. I would often look quickly and pass. They left me feeling unprepared and in need of translation. They stood alone, neither Byzantine nor of the Renaissance, an anomaly between chapters, like the orchestra tuning its strings in the interval.<br><br>This curiosity has deepened over the past two and a half decades. The colors, delicate patterns and suspended drama of these pictures gradually became necessary to me. Every few months I go to the National Gallery in order to look once more at Duccio di Buoninsegna&#x2019;s The Annunciation or The Healing of the Man Born Blind. The seeing, who include Jesus, his audience and the version of the blind man now healed, sedately occupy the lower half of the painting. They are contrasted by the playful and brightly crisp activity in the upper half of the picture, where a hopscotch of arches and windows, peering into empty spaces, stare openly. They seem to be deliberately leading one&#x2019;s gaze away from the human activity below. It is in that direction, upward, that the second representation of the blind man, the one still visually impaired, is facing. It is a painting that is questioning and ironic about what it might mean to truly see. It is not definite about the answer. It has always, and throughout all the many years that I have been returning to The Healing of the Man Born Blind, seemed to be a space of doubt.<br><br>If I am away from London for any significant period of time, there inevitably comes the moment when I must search in the local museums for something from the Sienese School, preferably by Duccio, for, although he is not necessarily the most excellent, he acts as the source from which Simone Martini, the Lorenzetti brothers&#x2014;Ambrogio and Pietro&#x2014;Giovanni di Paolo and all the others flowed. The precision and particular generosity of Duccio&#x2019;s work opened up a door through which others could pass. This unveiling of new territory must be one of the most remarkable achievements that an artist can attain. By challenging the imagination they nudge our perception a little and, for an instant at least, the world is remade. This exchange of ideas between the artists who walked through Duccio&#x2019;s door is nearly audible. To look closely at their work is to eavesdrop on one of the most captivating conversations in the history of art, one concerned with what a painting might be, what it might be for, and what it could do and accomplish within the intimate drama of a private engagement with a stranger. You can detect them asking how much a picture might rely on a viewer&#x2019;s emotional life; how a shared human experience might change the contract between artist and viewer, and between artist and subject; and what creative possibilities this new collaboration might offer.</p><h2>The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom (P.S.)</h2><p><p>In sumptuous and illuminating detail, Simon Winchester, the bestselling author of&nbsp;<em>The Professor and the Madman</em>&nbsp;("Elegant and scrupulous"&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em>) and&nbsp;<em>Krakatoa</em>&nbsp;("A mesmerizing page-turner"&#x2014;<em>Time</em>) brings to life the extraordinary story of Joseph Needham, the brilliant Cambridge scientist who unlocked the most closely held secrets of China, long the world's most technologically advanced country.</p><p>No cloistered don, this tall, married Englishman was a freethinking intellectual, who practiced nudism and was devoted to a quirky brand of folk dancing.

Shortly afterwards, in the middle of a storm on Christmas Eve, Edwin disappears, leaving nothing behind but some personal belongings and the suspicion that his jealous uncle John Jasper, madly in love with Rosa, is the killer. And beyond this presumed crime there are further intrigues: the dark opium dens of the sleepy cathedral town of Cloisterham, and the sinister double life of Choirmaster Jasper, whose drug-fuelled fantasy life belies his respectable appearance. Dickens died before completing <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, leaving its tantalising mystery unsolved and encouraging successive generations of readers to turn detective. This edition contains an introduction by David Paroissien, discussing the novel's ending, with a chronology, notes, original illustrations by Samuel Luke Fildes, appendices on opium use in the nineteenth century, the 'Sapsea Fragment' and Dickens's plans for the story's conclusion.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

From an early age, however, he knew his calling was to the priesthood. After his ordination, he served first as an Apostolic Delegate in Egypt, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Czechoslovakia, then in Rome at the Holy Office (now the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith). It was here in Rome that his greatest work began. After the surrender of Italy in 1943, Rome came under the command of Nazi Colonel Herbert Kappler of the dreaded SS, who began the deportation of Italian Jews to Auschwitz. Kappler was a notorious hater of the Jews, persecuting them at every turn. As a top man in the Vatican Holy Office, Msgr. O&#x2019;Flaherty sprang into action, organizing a sophisticated team that included men and women of many nationalities, religions, and political views. There was one goal? to save Jews and POWs from the Nazi machine. Despite Kappler&#x2019;s numerous attempts to assassinate him, O&#x2019;Flaherty persisted, and his efforts saved thousands of Jews and POWs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Using private homes and apartments, churches and monasteries, the effort was all orchestrated by Msgr. O&#x2019;Flaherty. Each day his familiar figure would stand on the steps of St. Peter&#x2019;s - neutral ground that even the Nazis wouldn&#x2019;t violate - to welcome any fugitives who might be sent his way. All told, of 9,700 Roman Jews, most were saved, with 1,007 shipped to Auschwitz. The rest were hidden, 5,000 of them by the official Church - 3,000 at the Pope&#x2019;s Castel Gandolfo, 200 or 400 (estimates vary) as "members" of the Palatine Guard, and some 1,500 in monasteries, convents and colleges. The remaining 3,700 were hidden in private homes, including Msgr. O'Flaherty's network of apartments. After the war, O&#x2019;Flaherty was honored by various Allied countries with awards and decorations for his heroic acts to save Jews and POWs.&nbsp;<b>Illustrated</b></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Punk Science: Inside the Mind of God</h2><p>Punk Science demonstrates that ideas from the cutting-edge of science actually explain phenomena that have previously been thought of as paranormal.

Inside this vibrant Moroccan community, internet cafes and mobile phones coexist with a maze of donkey-trod alleyways, thousand-year-old sewer systems, and Arab-style houses, gorgeous with intricate, if often shabby, mosaic work. <br> <br> While vacationing in Morocco, Suzanna Clarke and her husband, Sandy, are inspired to buy a dilapidated, centuries-old riad in Fez with the aim of restoring it to its original splendor, using only traditional craftsmen and handmade materials. So begins a remarkable adventure that is bewildering, at times hilarious, and ultimately immensely rewarding. <br> <br> <i>A House in Fez</i> chronicles their meticulous restoration, but it is also a journey into Moroccan customs and lore and a window into the lives of its people as friendships blossom. When the riad is finally returned to its former glory, Suzanna finds she has not just restored an old house, but also her soul.</p><p>Born in New Zealand, Suzanna Clarke grew up in several parts of Australia. In her twenties she lived in a Welsh commune, an Amsterdam squat and a Buddhist monastery in Nepal. She has worked as a photojournalist for more than two decades and is the arts director of The Daily Mail in Brisbane. Her husband, Sandy, is a radio broadcaster who now spends most of his time in Fez. Their blog is riadzany.blogspot.com.<b></b><p><b>1</b></p><p>When we mentioned our fantasy of buying a traditional Arab-style riad, or courtyard house, in Fez to a friend, he said dismissively, "What a terribly nineteenth-century thing to do."</p><p>He had a point. For most of my life I have been enchanted by tales of early European women travelers, such as Isabelle Eberhardt and Jane Digby, who broke out of the strictures of lives far more confining than my own and found another way to live in Arab cultures. Of course, such adventures are only romantic if you ignore the fact that Eberhardt, who disguised herself as a man, contracted syphilis then drowned penniless and alone, washed away with her final manuscript.</p><p>There were other acquaintances who, post-September 11, asked, "Why would you want to buy a house in a Muslim country? They hate us."</p><p>This was easier to counter; we knew it simply wasn't true of Moroccans, who can be friendly and hospitable to the point of overwhelming. We were also aware that people in Western countries tend to view Muslim nations as a monolithic bloc, whereas there are many cultural differences between them, despite common elements. The present King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, has built bridges with the West and was the first Muslim ruler to express sympathy for the United States following the destruction of the World Trade Center.</p><p>Besides, we saw our venture as an opportunity to explore Islamic culture further, and to gain a deeper insight into why the Way of the Prophet has thrived for so long.</p><p>There was a certain inevitability about my interest in Morocco. My parents had visited the country in 1961, long before it was fashionable to do so. At that time only a handful of hardy souls, forerunners of the hippies who were later to invade, made their way down from Spain, following the sun. Enthusiastic young travelers, Meg and Henry drove their Volkswagen beetle around Morocco's few, mostly unpaved, roads, and after some hair-raising adventures ended up pitching their tent in the camping ground at Marrakesh. It appears they had a particularly convivial time there, because I was born exactly nine months later.</p><p>Being conceived in Morocco and growing up in New Zealand, I learned to walk at a shuffle in my father's Moroccan babouches, surrounded by mementos from their visit. One of their more colorful tales was of the night they camped on the side of a road high in the Atlas Mountains. In the middle of the night, a truck came winding up from the valley below, its headlights swinging across my parents' tent. They stayed in their sleeping bags, hoping it would continue past, but when the truck drew level with their car its engine stopped.</p><p>Rocks crunched as footsteps moved toward them. My father, deciding drastic action was called for, unzipped his sleeping bag, grabbed the tomahawk, and when he judged the moment was right, leaped out wearing only striped pajama bottoms and swinging the tomahawk above his head, bellowing a Maori haka. <i>"Ka mate, ka mate, ka ora, ka ora, Tenei te tangata puhuruhuru..."</i> ("It is death! It is death! It is life! It is life! This is the hairy man...")</p><p>He must have been a terrifying sight, because four djellaba-clad men ran to their truck and sped off into the night. I wonder if those men now tell their grandchildren about the time they stopped to help the occupants of a car they thought had broken down and were confronted by a screaming madman.</p><p>By early 2003, the idea of buying a house in Fez was sufficiently implanted for Sandy and me to start putting money aside. Forget buying a new car, clothes, or even basic house maintenance -- this was our escape fund. The second part of our plan was to get ourselves back there without dipping into it.</p><p>The previous year, we had taken holiday jobs as tour managers for a small group of well-heeled tourists in France and the United Kingdom. Now we proposed Morocco as a destination. After studying and planning for months, we flew out in October and showed our group as much of Morocco as was possible in three short weeks, with the help of a local guide. It was spring and the countryside had transformed from the dry brown of our previous trip to lush green, liberally sprinkled with poppies, irises, daisies, and other wildflowers.</p><p>Tour leading entailed a level of luxury entirely different from what we were accustomed to, and it wasn't always for the better. Inside a four- or five-star hotel, with the exception of a few designer touches, you could be almost anywhere in the world. There was a sameness, a monotone, that irked us both, but for some of our guests such accommodation still wasn't up to par.</p><p>"I thought there'd be hair dryers in the hotel bathrooms," one wealthy woman whined.</p><p>Many people in Morocco don't even have running water, never mind washing machines or refrigeration, so hair dryers are not considered an essential item. But to her mind they were, and she left us in no doubt that Sandy and I were negligent for not ensuring their presence.</p><p>We had gone to great lengths to give our clients a varied cultural experience, but it wasn't always to their taste. We arranged some of our city stays in beautiful riads, which, being several hundred years old, had rooms that were not standard sizes. Nor were the bathrooms always ideal.</p><p>"Why can't we stay in the new part of town?" an elderly man complained. "I'm tired of all this history."</p><p>It wasn't a sentiment Sandy and I shared. When we reached Fez we stood gazing down over the ancient walls of the Medina and the decrepit houses within, just biding their time for people with the vision, money, time, and energy to restore them. We confirmed to each other that those people should include us.</p><p>During my internet surfing, I had come across the website of an American living in Fez who claimed that, although the Medina is the best-preserved medieval walled city in the world, its architectural heritage is under threat. Many Moroccans cannot afford to maintain the houses they live in, let alone restore them to their original splendor. If those with the means to do so, foreigners included, were to rescue some of the significant houses, this would make a big difference to the preservation of the Medina. The key point, the website argued, was the need for proper restoration, as opposed to modernization. And rather than gentrification, a healthy mix of rich and poor living together, as had always been the case in the past, was the ideal.</p><p>One night, Sandy and I escaped from our tour group to meet the website's author, David Amster, over a drink. Originally from Chicago, David was in his mid-forties, amiable, intelligent, with a wonderfully dry sense of humor. His full-time job was director of the American Language Center in Fez, and he had called the city home for seven years. He was a passionate advocate for the traditional architecture of the Medina, about which he was extremely knowledgeable, giving lectures to visitors from the Smithsonian Institute once or twice a year. He owned five houses in Fez, one of which was a ruin. It had completely collapsed, leaving only columns and mosaics, which made it resemble a Roman temple.</p><p>"What are you going to do with it?" Sandy asked.</p><p>"At the moment," David said, "I have no idea. The site's under six feet of rubble. It'll take hundreds of donkey hours to move."</p><p>But he didn't appear too concerned. "Look," he continued, pulling out of his bag a sliver of wrought iron that looked like an oversized thumb tack and passing it to me. "Isn't it beautiful? It's a handmade nail."</p><p>This nail, several hundred years old, was to be the prototype for those David was having made. After months of searching, he had finally found a man with the necessary skills, but there was to be one small difference: the heads of the new nails would be slightly bigger, so that future experts could tell old from new.</p><p>Sandy and I exchanged glances. This was restoration on a whole new level. It wasn't just popping down to the hardware store and getting a bag of cheap Chinese nails and a bit of two-by-four. There was obviously more to doing up a house here than we realized.</p><p>"Would you like to see the house I live in?" David asked. "I've had a builder and his team working on it for four years."</p><p>He didn't need to ask twice. Leaving the modern quarter, we passed under the Bab Bou Jeloud -- the Blue Gate -- and into the Medina, then down innumerable dark alleys populated by cats who blinked at us, or slunk away on our approach. In the moonlight, one alley looked much like another and I was amazed at David's unerring sense of direction. We finally arrived at a large doorway, and as he ushered us in the first thing I noticed was the strong, fragrant smell of freshly sanded cedarwood.</p><p>We were standing in a dimly lit courtyard with an atrium stretching high above. All around was a wealth of decoration: blue, green, and white tilework -- or <i>zellij</i> -- intricate plaster and wood carving, and two enormous cedar doors. It was like a jewel box, its beauty so overwhelming it was hard to imagine living in such a palace.</p><p>In contrast, the furniture was surprisingly Spartan: a bed, a single chair, nowhere to cook as yet. But who needs possessions and comforts when you wake up every day to such splendor? We had never envisioned anything like this. The prospect of restoring such a house was at once daunting and thrilling.</p><p>A few days later, I farewelled Sandy and the tour party at Casablanca airport. Sandy had to return to Australia for work, but I caught the train back to Fez, with the intention of finding us a house.Copyright � 2007 by Suzanna Clarke</p></p><h2>Each Moment Is the Universe: Zen and the Way of Being Time</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to regard time as a commodity&#x2014;we even speak of &#x201c;saving&#x201d; or &#x201c;spending&#x201d; it. We often regard it as an enemy, when we feel it slipping away before we&#x2019;re ready for time to be up. The Zen view of time is radically different than that: time is not something separate from our life; rather, our life <i>is</i> time. Understand this, says Dainin Katagiri Roshi, and you can live fully and freely right where you are in each moment.&nbsp; <br><br>Katagiri bases his teaching on <i>Being Time</i>, a text by the most famous of all Zen masters, Eihei Dogen (1200&#x2013;1253), to show that time is a creative, dynamic process that continuously produces the universe and everything in it&#x2014;and that to understand this is to discover a gateway to freedom from the dissatisfactions of everyday life. He guides us in contemplating impermanence, the present moment, and the ungraspable nature of past and future. He discusses time as part of our inner being, made manifest through constant change in ourselves and our surroundings. And these ideas are by no means metaphysical abstractions: they can be directly perceived by any of us through meditation.</p><p>Born in Osaka, Japan, in 1928, Dainin Katagiri was trained traditionally as a Zen teacher. He first came to the United States in 1963, to help with a Soto Zen Temple in Los Angeles. He later joined Shunryu Suzuki Roshi at the San Francisco Zen Center and taught there until Suzuki Roshi&#x2019;s death in 1971. He was then invited to form a new Zen center in Minneapolis, which, in addition to a monastery in the countryside of Minnesota, he oversaw until his death in 1990. He left behind a legacy of recorded teachings and twelve Dharma heirs. Katagiri is the author of several books, including <i>Returning to Silence</i> and <i>You Have to Say Something.</i><i>Starred Review.</i> Move over, Martin Heidegger. The late Japanese Zen master Katagiri Roshi offers a Zen interpretation of being and time. As text editor Andrea Martin explains in her introduction, the core Buddhist teachings of impermanence and emptiness lend themselves to considerations of time and being. Zen may be anticoncept and nonabstract, but it is certainly pro-insight. So Katagiri explains his understanding of time, based squarely on his interpretation of the work of influential 13th-century Zen master Dogen, whose work has inspired a number of contemporary Zen teachers. But Katagiri is no academic, and the language he uses to express complex ideas is extremely simple (this is called going into mud and water) and often enthusiastic (Touch it and bounce!). The editor has successfully transmitted the oral style that helps make the content accessible. Katagiri conveys a zest for Zen understanding that differs from the calm inscrutability of other Zen Buddhists; he also brings up terms like hope and beauty. Katagiri's statement I think the purpose of spiritual life is to just go toward the future with great hope may sound metaphysical, but it comes from a teacher who has spent time on the meditation cushion and applied insight to the day-to-day life that Zen embraces. <i>(July 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How do we become good relatives? How do we become good ancestors? How do we learn to live together? Blending personal narrative and broader historical and cultural analysis with close readings of key creative and critical texts, Justice argues that Indigenous writers engage with these questions in part to challenge settler-colonial policies and practices that have targeted Indigenous connections to land, history, family, and self. More importantly, Indigenous writers imaginatively engage the many ways that communities and individuals have sought to nurture these relationships and project them into the future. </p><p></p><p>This provocative volume challenges readers to critically consider and rethink their assumptions about Indigenous literature, history, and politics while never forgetting the emotional connections of our shared humanity and the power of story to effect personal and social change. Written with a generalist reader firmly in mind but addressing issues of interest to specialists in the field, this book welcomes new audiences to Indigenous literary studies while offering more seasoned readers a renewed appreciation for these transformative literary traditions.</p></p><p><p><b>Daniel Heath Justice</b> (Cherokee Nation) is Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Literature and Expressive Culture at the University of British Columbia. A widely published scholar in Indigenous literary studies, he is the co-editor of the groundbreaking <i>Oxford Handbook of Indigenous American Literature</i> (2014) and author of a Cherokee literary history, a cultural history of badgers, and an Indigenous epic fantasy series.</p>This book simultaneously affirms Indigenous writing, introduces Indigenous readers to the canon of Indigenous writing, and teaches non-Indigenous folks how to read our literatures. That&#x2019;s impressive, and it&#x2019;s done in a beautiful, intimate and at times playful way. Why Indigenous Literatures Matter was an honour to read.

Angry and heartbroken, he ended up living on the streets and abandoned any belief he'd once had in God.<br> Ten years later Big Earl meets Gideon, a seven-year-old leukemia patient who believes with all her heart that "Christmas means never having to ask God how much he loves us." Gideon is determined to reach this lonely and hurting man who hates Christmas--and he is just as determined to rebuff her. It will take a miracle for Earl to come to understand the true meaning of Christmas. But if he can accept what Gideon wants to give him, he might find that he can return the favor with a precious gift of his own.<br> In GIDEON'S GIFT, Karen Kingsbury reminds us that Christmas is still a time of miraculous possibilities if only we reach out to those around us.<br></p><p>Karen Kingsbury is a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of over 60 works of fiction and nonfiction with nearly 25 million copies in print.

This eager if predictable novella will please her established fans, and may win a few new ones as well, provided they are armed with enough Kleenex. In the story, the Scrooge-like Earl Badgett-a grumpy and aggressive version of the typical widower of CBA fiction-has his Christian faith revived through the efforts of an eight-year-old girl. Pious, mature children who lead adults back to faith were a staple of 19th-century domestic fiction, and remain so in the CBA today; sweet little Gideon Mercer is no exception. And if the novel's emotional quotient weren't high enough, she's even suffering from leukemia. Despite the overwrought stereotypes, Kingsbury writes quite well; her skill with pacing goes a long way toward redeeming this tired and contrived plot.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Why Art?</h2><p>What is &#x201c;Art&#x201d;? It&#x2019;s widely accepted that art serves an important function in society. But the concept falls under such an absurdly large umbrella and can manifest in so many different ways. Art can be self indulgent, goofy, serious, altruistic, evil, or expressive, or any number of other things. But how can it truly make lasting, positive change? In Why Art?, acclaimed graphic novelist Eleanor Davis (How To Be Happy) unpacks some of these concepts in ways both critical and positive, in an attempt to illuminate the highest possible potential an artwork might hope to achieve. A work of art unto itself, Davis leavens her exploration with a sense of humor and a thirst for challenging preconceptions of art worth of Magritte, instantly drawing the reader in as a willing accomplice in her quest.</p><p>Raised in Tucson, Arizona, Eleanor Davis lives in Athens, Georgia with her husband, the cartoonist Drew Weing.&#x201c;Eccentric and visually inventive, answering all the many questions it raises,&nbsp;<em>Why Art?</em>&nbsp;is about the power that comes from creating.

Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille were two of the five principals of the CIA team tasked with hunting one of their own and were directly responsible for identifying Ames as the mole, leading to his arrest and conviction.<br><p>One of the most destructive traitors in American history, CIA officer Aldrich Ames provided information to the Soviet Union that contributed to the deaths of at least ten Soviet intelligence officers who spied for the United States. In this book, the two CIA officers directly responsible for tracking down Ames chronicle their involvement in the hunt for a mole. Considering it their personal mission, Grimes and Vertefeuille dedicated themselves to identifying the traitor responsible for the execution or imprisonment of the Soviet agents with whom they worked. Their efforts eventually led them to a long-time acquaintance and coworker in the CIA's Soviet-East European division and Counterintelligence Center, Aldrich Ames.<br></p><p>Not only is this the first book to be written by the CIA principals involved, but it is also the first to provide details of the operational contact with the agents Ames betrayed. The book covers the political aftermath of Ames's arrest, including the Congressional wrath for not identifying him sooner, the FBI/CIA debriefings following Ames's plea bargain, and a retrospective of Ames the person and Ames the spy. It is also the compelling story of two female agents, who overcame gender barriers and succeeded in bringing Ames to justice in a historically male-oriented organization. Now retired from the CIA, Grimes and Vertefeuille are finally able to tell this inside story of the CIA's most notorious traitor and the men he betrayed.</p></p><p>Sandra Grimes was a twenty-six year veteran of CIA's Clandestine Service who spent the majority of her career working against the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. She joined the CIA in July 1967 shortly after graduating from the University of Washington with a degree in Russian. A mother of two grown daughters and four grandchildren, she currently lives in Great Falls, Virginia, with her husband of forty-plus years.<br><br>Jeanne Vertefeuille was a CIA officer during the Cold War 1954-1992, specializing in the Soviet target, particularly in the Counterintelligence area. She led the small task force which resulted in the arrest of Soviet mole Aldrich Ames in 1994. Subsequently she served on contract as an analyst 1993-present and died just after the publication of the book in hardcover."<i>Circle of Treason</i> is an enormously important account of a complex, often frustrating, case written by those who did much of the work to break it."<b><i>--Studies in Intelligence</i></b><br><br>"The authors provide intriguing insights into the background and tradecraft of a number of productive operations the CIA ran against the GRU and KGB from the 1960s through the 1980s. They also show how, when operations went wrong or were compromised by traitors, sources paid with their lives. <i>Circle of Treason</i> has the advantage of being written by two intelligence professionals, not by academics or journalists, and thus is an authoritative account of the Soviet sources that were providing the U.S. with invaluable information during the Cold War until Ames betrayed them. Because classified material on operational cases was going to be made public, the CIA took over three years to approve the book's publication. The authors note that 90% of the disputes were resolved in their favor." <b><i>--The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"In a brutally frank account of CIA traitor Aldrich Ames's career, Grimes, a 26-year veteran of the CIA's Clandestine Service, and Vertefeuille, a long-time CIA counterintelligence officer, pull back the curtain on the hunt for an American who spent years working for the KGB without being discovered. Espionage buffs will love the details taken from previously classified CIA files, as well as a penetrating view of him as an "All-American boy" and spy. Well-researched and written in a clear, no-frills style, this fascinating Cold War saga will allow any American without a security clearance to better understand how Aldrich Ames could have become one of the most damaging moles in U.S. intelligence history." <b><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"What makes this volume interesting is that it was written by longtime CIA insiders, who saw firsthand how the agency's network inside the Soviet Union crumbled. They write authentic sketches of agents working for the CIA who were betrayed by Ames, such as Dmitriy Polyakov, a general in the GRU (Soviet military intelligence), the highest-ranking Soviet official in uniform to spy for the United States during the Cold War, who was arrested and executed after Ames identified him. This book adds an insider perspective to the bookshelf..." --<b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"The Ames story of vast treasonous duplicity may have been often told, but this is an insiders' perspective, with clarifying details and upfront identification of the vicious damages, the sad glories and the assorted 'warts' of the case. It provides an extraordinarily detailed discussion of the agents and their secrets betrayed by Ames, with stunning assessments of the devastating losses for all structural and human components. Having met the criteria and demands of the CIA's Publications and Review Board provides prima facie notice of cooperation, but the depth and intricacy of the revelations simply must be seen in print to be believed. Whatever the rationale for the unabashed candor, there is a truism [that has always been known inside Langley but not always in a Hollywood context], 'you could not make up this stuff.' Indeed Mmes. Grimes and Vertefeuille, did not make it up, but relate it in intimate, excruciating, and spellbinding details, making it all the more extraordinary and worth reading." -- <i><b>American Ex-Prisoners of War Bulletin</b></i><br><br>"...[A] fine book which is gripping without any pyrotechnics, a story that could not be told except by the women who brought Ames down." -- The Dispatch (Columbus, MS)<br><br>"Circle of Treason, written by two women CIA employees--Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille--is an extraordinary tribute to their training, ingenuity, years of service and access to CIA top secret files, Soviet agents collaborating with the CIA, and FBI colleagues. It took them years to uncover the CIA mole in their midst. The book is a tribute to their work." --Betty McIntosh, retired CIA officer and author of Sisterhood of Spies<br><br>"All in all, Circle of Treason is a disturbing read, but an essential one for anyone interested in the intricate detail work involved in a counterintelligence investigation -- and a tribute to two women who helped push it to a conclusion." -- The Washington Times<br><br>"This is an important contribution to the field of literature. Although there are a half dozen books dealing with the Aldrich Ames case, they are of very differing quality and none contains all the background information on sources which CIA recruited inside the KGB and GRU that this book contains. Also, this is an 'insider' story. These two women actually participated in the running of some of these operations, watched their sources being arrested and executed by the Soviets, and then spent years of their lives uncovering Ames, the 'mole' who gave it all away. Very engagingly written. For me it was a page-turner!" --RADM Thomas A. Brooks, USN (Ret.), former Director of Naval Intelligence<br><br>"Only the authors of Circle of Treason could write this fascinating insider account, which not only deals with their tenacious, painstaking pursuit of the CIA's most damaging spy but also reveals the extraordinary efforts the CIA took to ensure the safety of its sources fighting the oppressive Soviet regime. This is essential reading for intelligence professionals and for anyone interested in the day-to-day reality behind Cold War espionage." --Michael Sulick, former Director of CIA's National Clandestine Service</p><h2>The Golden Compass / The Subtle Knife / The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials)</h2><p><p><b><i><b><i>HIS DARK MATERIALS </i></b></i><b>IS NOW AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES STARRING DAFNE KEEN, RUTH WILSON, JAMES McAVOY, AND LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA!</b><i><br><br>The Golden Compass</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Subtle Knife</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Amber Spyglass</i> are available together in a collectible His Dark Materials boxed set perfect for any fan or newcomer to this modern fantasy classic series that has graced the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>,&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>,&nbsp;<i>Book Sense</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;bestseller lists.</b><br><br>These thrilling adventures tell the story of Lyra and Will&#x2014;two ordinary children on a perilous journey through shimmering haunted otherworlds.

They have used the secrets of the Mind Walkers to speak with the spirits of the fallen, risking their lives in the process. They have faced a team of Sith assassins and beaten the odds to destroy them. And now the death squad&#x2019;s sole survivor, Sith apprentice Vestara Khai, has summoned an entire fleet of Sith frigates to engage the embattled father and son. But the dark warriors come bearing a surprising proposition that will bring Jedi and Sith together in an unprecedented alliance against an adversary more ancient and alien than they can imagine. For in the treacherous web of black holes that is the Maw, the Skywalkers and their Sith allies will have to fight an unimaginable evil, and Luke will be rocked by a staggering truth.</p><p><b>Christie Golden</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than thirty novels, including <i>Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi: Omen,</i> and several short stories in the fields of fantasy, science fiction, and horror.

But then his father got arrested and exiled for a decade. Jedi who had spent formative years on Shelter in the Maw-and yes, Ben was among that number, how reassuring was that little fact-started going crazy. Ben and Luke had learned about some creepy powerful being with dark slithery mental tendrils of need who was probably responsible for the crazy Jedi, and had been going to pay her a visit inside the Maw when they abducted a Sith. One that was definitely easy on the eyes, but who was nonetheless a Sith, from a whole planetload of them, no less. A Sith who was still with them right now, standing and smirking at them while nearly a dozen frigates crammed with her pals surrounded them.<br><br>Yeah. He would definitely be older than his dad.<br><br>Luke had followed the instructions given by the unnamed, unseen Sith commander of the Black Wave, placing the Shadow in a parking orbit around Dathomir. There was no other choice, not with eleven ChaseMaster frigates ready to open fire.<br><br>"A wise decision," Vestara said. "I'm fond of my own life, so I'm glad you're cooperating, but if you had attempted to flee they most certainly would have destroyed you."<br><br>Luke eyed her thoughtfully. Clearly, he wasn't so sure.<br><br>"So," Ben continued, "what are they going to do with us? Are we going to be the main attraction at some kind of Sith ritual party?"<br><br>"I've no idea," Vestara said. She might be lying through her teeth. She might be telling the truth. Ben simply couldn't be sure.<br><br>"Your cooperation is appreciated, Master Skywalker," came the voice that had first hailed them. Ben and Luke exchanged puzzled glances. Of course, Vestara had told them who was holding her captive, but why the courtesy and respectful title?<br><br>"I am High Lord Sarasu Taalon, commander of this force," the voice continued. "Your reputation precedes you. We have studied you, and your son, a great deal."<br><br>"I wish I could say the same," Luke said. "I know nothing about you and your people, High Lord Taalon."<br><br>"No, you don't. But I am prepared for that to change . . . somewhat. Your vessel carries a Z-95 Headhunter."<br><br>"It does," Luke said. "I presume you're about to ask me to come over to your flagship and chat over a nice glass of something."<br><br>"You and Vestara, yes," Taalon said. "You will have to turn her back over to us, of course. But there is no reason we can't be civilized about this."<br><br>"No thanks," Luke said. "Anything you have to say to me can be said at a distance. Vestara isn't the worst companion I've ever traveled with. I think I'll let her stay here with us for a while longer."<br><br>Ben looked again at the Sith girl. His father was right. She wasn't the worst companion he'd ever traveled with.<br><br>"Let us revisit that subject in a moment," came Taalon's reply. "As I'm sure you know by now, Apprentice Vestara Khai has done a commendable job of keeping us informed of what has transpired. We are aware that you are having . . . difficulty with certain Jedi who were fostered inside the Maw. We believe this is due to the intervention of a being known to us as Abeloth, whom Vestara encountered. Many of our own apprentices are displaying the same symptoms as your younger Jedi."<br><br>"Your younger Sith were in the Maw as well?"<br><br>"No. But such identical displays of aberrant behavior cannot be attributed to anything else."<br><br>Ben was skeptical. But there was so much they didn't know yet. His father's blue eyes met his and he shrugged slightly. It was possible.<br><br>"We are many. You are only three," Taalon continued. The third to whom he referred was Dyon Stad a Force-sensitive human who had joined Ben and Luke on Dathomir and was currently aboard his own Suieb Soro yacht "We have a common cause."<br><br>"Are-are you proposing a formal alliance?" Luke was so surprised he didn't even bother to hide it. Ben, too, literally gaped for a moment. Vestara seemed more shocked than any of them, judging by her expression and her feeling in the Force.<br><br>"Precisely."<br><br>Luke started to laugh. "I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like a very Sith thing to say."<br><br>The voice was cold when Taalon spoke again. "This creature, this . . . Abeloth . . . has the audacity to reach out and harm our apprentices. Our tyros. To toy with the Tribe-the Sith. The insult cannot be borne. It will not be borne. We are going into the Maw and teach her a lesson."<br><br>Ben glanced at his father. "That, however, is a very Sith thing to say."<br><br>Luke nodded. To Taalon, he said, "It may be that we do not need to teach her a lesson, as it were. We may simply need to find out why she is doing this."<br><br>"And ask her nicely to please stop?" Ben thought Han Solo could learn a thing or two from this Sith about infusing one's voice with sarcasm.<br><br>"You just asked me nicely to help you out. Clearly you're capable of good manners," Luke replied, unruffled. "If it accomplishes the goal with fewer or perhaps no casualties, how is that not the best solution?"<br><br>There was silence. "It is possible she may not be amenable to . . . polite conversation. What then, Master Skywalker?"<br><br>"I will do whatever is necessary to free the ill Jedi from her control," Luke said. "I assure you of that." His voice was not harsh, but there was a tone in it Ben recognized. The deed was almost as good as done when Luke Skywalker spoke like that.<br><br>"You agree, then?" Taalon asked.<br><br>Luke didn't answer at once. Ben knew what he was struggling with. And he was surprised that it was even a struggle for the Grand Master. Luke was a Jedi. These were Sith. There couldn't possibly be an alliance. Everyone would constantly be watching their own backs.<br><br>But then again . . . He glanced at Vestara. She came from an entire culture of Sith. They couldn't be backstabbing one another constantly- they'd have become extinct long ago. Somehow this flavor of Sith had learned how to cooperate. Vestara had proved it was possible. She had worked with Ben and his father before, on Dathomir, and that cooperation had saved Luke Skywalker's life.<br><br>"We do have a common goal," Luke said at last. "It would be better to work toward it together rather than getting in each other's way. But don't think that I will not be expecting treachery at every turn. There are fewer enmities more ancient than that of Sith and Jedi."<br><br>A sigh. "This thing we both fight might be older than that," Taalon said. "Well, I did not expect this to be a particularly comradely union. Very well. You deliver Vestara Khai. Together, in an alliance not seen since this galaxy was new, Sith and Jedi will confront and defeat their mutual foe-one way or the other. And after that . . . well, let us see where we stand then, shall we?"<br><br>"Vestara stays here."<br><br>The Sith girl froze. There was a long silence.<br><br>"I cannot permit that."<br><br>"Then we have no alliance." Another long silence.<br><br>"She has information we require. She comes with us, or there is no deal."<br><br>"Information about how to reach and confront our mutual foe?" Luke said, turning Taalon's own flowery words back on him. "That, I do not object to permitting her to share. That was the information you were talking about, wasn't it?"<br><br>"She will come to no harm while entrusted in your . . . care," said Taalon. "None. Or we will attack and destroy you down to your marrow and obliterate your very cells."<br><br>"Provided you keep your bargain, she's perfectly safe. Jedi aren't in the habit of torturing children."<br><br>Vestara frowned at being referred to as a child. Ben started to smile a little, despite the situation, then realized that she was the same age as he was. He shot his dad a disappointed glance.<br><br>"Then I believe we have an agreement," Taalon said.<br><br>"Not just yet. We need to decide who is going to be in charge of this alliance first."<br><br>"I would suggest we command as a pair, you and I," Taalon said. "No Sith will take orders solely from a Jedi. And I am sure you would bridle at being told what to do by a Sith High Lord."<br><br>"I would indeed. And I would suggest we begin this joint command by sharing information. You first."<br><br>"Ah, but Master Skywalker, you have our source of information right there with you. Start with her. We will be prepared to depart within a half hour."<br><br>"So will we. I'll be in touch. Jade Shadow out."<br><br>"Dad," Ben said the second the communication was terminated. "You just agreed to help the Sith."<br><br>Luke shook his head. "No, son. I agreed to let the Sith help us."<br><br>Ben regarded him, incredulity mixed with curiosity. "You trust them to keep their word?"<br><br>"I trust them to do what is best for them. And as long as what is best for them is best for us, then we'll be fine."<br><br>"And when it's not?"<br><br>"Like Taalon said . . . we'll see where we stand then. I'm prepared for that. There are two old sayings, Ben: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' and 'keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.' "<br><br>Luke pointedly turned to Vestara, who stood straight with her hands clasped behind her back. "Now," he said, "High Lord Taalon assures me you know everything they do."<br><br>She lifted a small information chip. "Most of it's here," she said.<br><br>"And what's not there?" Luke asked.<br><br>Vestara smiled slightly and tapped her temple. "And this is where it will stay until it is necessary. We have a card game on my world. It is called Mahaa'i Shuur, which means Ultimate Success in the tongue of the natives. The rules are complicated, but the goal is simple. The winner is the one who never, ever has to play his last card."<br><br>Luke Skywalker watched Vestara Khai the way, long ago, a bartender named Wuher had watched him at the Mos Eisley cantina-coldly, expecting the unexpected, and looking for an excuse to cease being civil. Her back was to him, hands on her hips, her long brown hair hanging loose. She was looking out over the gathering of Sith vessels that were starting to fall into formation in preparation for departure, and he didn't have to sense her in the Force to make a damn good guess as to what she might be thinking. As soon as he had the thought Luke amended it.<br><br>She was Sith. So were they. In Luke's mind, that automatically meant they could not be trusted. Even if they were sincere in this desire to unite forces and approach the Maw with a lot more firepower than the Jade Shadow would have mustered alone, there had to be a trick, or a trap. They were Sith. Deception was a keystone of their culture.<br><br>Vestara Khai was Sith. But she was also a girl who seemed to have at least a few virtues along with her vices, something Luke found unexpected and disconcerting. No doubt she was contemplating treachery. But he was willing to admit that she also might just be missing her people. A soft sigh escaped her, as if confirming his thoughts.<br><br>He had assigned Ben the job of being the first to read through the information Vestara had given them, thinking the task would distract his son from the admittedly attractive female his own age who was going to be living in such close quarters with them. He was not worried for Ben's state of mind regarding the Force. Ben had been through more things in his short life than most beings had in century- long ones. He wasn't likely to be tempted by offers of power or greatness, the usual tools those who tried to corrupt Jedi liked to employ.<br><br>But it was, Luke realized, entirely possible that Ben might get a little confused now and then. Vestara was strikingly attractive, and had presumably been through things comparable to what Ben had undergone. And she was extremely, in fact exceptionally, strong in the Force. It was a combination that might make any father at least a little anxious for his Jedi son's well-being.<br><br>The Shadow was quiet, the air heavy with all the "not talking" that was taking place. The only sound was Vestara's single, almost inaudible sigh and the occasional sounds of Ben shifting position in his chair as he read and occasionally cross-referenced data.<br><br>The sudden noise alerting them to an incoming message therefore sounded especially loud. No one actually jumped, but a sense of surprise rippled through them all. Luke glanced at the screen and frowned slightly. Three words flashed.<br><br>vestara khai. personal.<br><br>As far as Luke was concerned, they might as well have been emergency incoming attack.<br><br>"Who's it from, Dad?"<br><br>"I don't know. But it's for our guest. Do you know who might want to contact you, Vestara?"<br><br>Vestara actually looked surprised. Luke felt the faintest flicker of worry, like an echo of a whisper, in the Force. "I've no idea," and it sounded genuine. "Is there a place where I can-"<br><br>"I can't let you receive a private message, especially from someone who won't identify him- or herself," Luke said matter-of-factly.<br><br>Vestara nodded. "Of course not. If I were in your position, I would take similar precautions."<br><br>Luke flipped a switch. "This is the Jade Shadow to the anonymous sender of the previous message directed at Vestara Khai. You must understand I cannot permit her to receive a private missive."<br><br>There was a long silence. Luke could feel young ears straining. Then another message appeared, addressed to luke skywalker.<br><br>the message may be publicly viewed.<br><br>"Well, a reasonable Sith, what next," Luke muttered, and touched another button on the console.<br><br>A small holographic figure took shape. It was a human male, wearing the traditional Sith black robes. A lightsaber of antique-looking design was clipped to his belt. His long dark hair was pulled up in a topknot. His face was chiseled and handsome.<br><br>Vestara's startled gasp revealed her emotions, but the Force did so even more prominently. There was a rush of warm, affectionate feelings, quickly clamped down, as if a lid had been put on a pot. Luke's eyes flickered to the girl, then back to the hologram. Both images appeared to be trying hard not to smile, although Vestara often looked as though she were smiling when she wasn't due to the little scar on her mouth.</p><h2>Strength Training Exercises for Women: Tone, Sculpt, and Stay Strong for Life</h2><p>Packed with more than 200 visual step-by-step exercises designed to burn calories, strengthen the core, and tone the body, <i>Strength Training for Women</i> is a must-have for core-conscious women who want to target key areas of their body and maintain all-round strength and fitness.</p><p><b>Joan Pagano</b> is certified in health and fitness instruction by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).

Snoopy has become the strip&#39;s dominant personality, and this volume marks two milestones for the character: the first of many &#34;dogfights&#34; with the nefarious Red Baron, and the launch of his writing career (&#34;It was a dark and stormy night...&#34;). Two new characters - the first two from outside the strip&#39;s regular little neighborhood - make their bows. Roy (who befriends Charlie Brown and then Linus at summer camp) won&#39;t have a lasting impact, but upon his return from camp he regales a friend of his with tales of the strange kids he met, and she has to go check them out for herself. Her name? Peppermint Patty.</p><p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold.

Flagg, Gordon</p><h2>Graphic Design Theory: Readings from the Field</h2><p>The titles in our best-selling Design Brief series are highly praised by graphic design students, educators, and professionals worldwide as invaluable resources. Each beautifully designed, affordable volume offers a concise overview of a design fundamentalthe hows of design. But as most seasoned designers will tell you, a comprehensive education also requires an understanding of the whys of design practice. <em>Graphic Design Theory</em> presents groundbreaking, primary texts from the most important historical and contemporary designthinkers. From Aleksandr Rodchenko's "Who We Are: Manifesto of the Constructivist Group" to Kenya Hara's "Computer Technology and Design," this essential volume provides the necessary foundation for contemporary critical vocabulary and thought. <br><br><em>Graphic Design Theory</em> is organized in three sections: "Creating the Field" traces the evolution of graphic design over the course of the early 1900s, including influential avant-garde ideas of futurism, constructivism, and the Bauhaus; "Building on Success" covers the mid- to late twentieth century and considers the International Style, modernism, and postmodernism; and "Mapping the Future" opens at the end of the last century and includes current discussions on legibility, social responsibility, and new media. Striking color images illustrate each of the movements discussed and demonstrate the ongoing relationship between theory and practice. A brief commentary prefaces each text, providing a cultural and historical framework through which the work can be evaluated. Authors include such influential designers as Herbert Bayer, Lszl Moholy-Nagy, Karl Gerstner, Katherine McCoy, Michael Rock, Lev Manovich, Ellen Lupton, and Lorraine Wild. Additional features include a timeline, glossary, and bibliography for further reading. A must-have survey for graduate and undergraduate courses in design history, theory, and contemporary issues, <em>Graphic Design Theory</em> invites designers and interested readers of all levels to plunge into the world of design discourse.</p><p>Helen Armstrong teaches in the Art History, Theory, and Criticism Department at Maryland Institute College of Art. She is the Principal and Creative Director of Strong Design in Baltimore."I heartily recommend this book for anyone seeking a friendly, concise overview of graphic design theory. The texts included are fresh and provocative. And the book design makes it a pleasure to read (particularly in comparison to the Looking Closer series). Each group of texts is followed by a section of vivid images called "Theory at Work" that explicates the ideas presented. I plan to reach for this book any time I need to stimulate my brain and/or my design." -- Hartleib --Share Brain, April 29, 2009<br><br>"An intro to design theory featuring essays from some of the industry's most important contemporary thinkers." --How Magazine<br><br>"Design and Reflexivity by Jan Van Toorn. Appears in the book Graphic Design Theory: Readings From the Field edited by Helen Armstrong, published by Princeton Architectural Press.The political in design is often looked at in a context of making a political statement but neglects the political process linked to design itself. The circumstances and intentions that lie behind the designer are assumed to be transparent, but in a market economy the profit will always be the underlying factor. In this sense Van Toorn argues that in order for design to function it accepts the established order as the basis of its actions. Social order legitimizes design and in turn it becomes necessary for design to legitimize the social order as well, creating a system that denies a critical look into the system itself (102). Acknowledge this realization, reality becomes a concept that is separated from design it becomes difficult for design to become much more that representations of the representations of the current system." - Michael Carbaugh --Michael Carbaugh<br><br>"This book offers a great primer on graphic design theory by collecting 24 essays from design luminaries like Jan Tschichold, Lorraine Wild, Paul Rand, El Lissitzky, Herbert Bayer, and more, culled from writings spanning more than a century on wide ranging topics from typography to the social responsibilities of a designer.

Models of clarity and control, they exemplified the classical poetics of the Augustan age.<br>This volume contains a rich selection of Pope's work, including such well-known poems as the title selection &#x2014; a philosophical meditation on the nature of the universe and man's place in it &#x2014; and "The Rape of the Lock," a mock-epic of rare charm and skill. Also included are "Ode on Solitude," "The Dying Christian to His Soul," "Elegy&nbsp; to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady," "An Essay on Criticism," "Epigram Engraved on the Collar of a Dog," "Epistle [IV] to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington: Of the Use of Riches," "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot; or, Prologue to the Satires" and more.<br>Taken together, these poems offer an excellent sampling of Pope's imaginative genius and the felicitous blending of word, idea and image that earned him a place among the leading lights of 18th-century literature.</p><p></p><h2>The Craft - A Witch&#39;s Book of Shadows</h2><p><p>Celebrate the changing of the seasons and the beauty and power of the Moon, the Stars, and the Sun. Written by a Witch who has spent many years teaching the Craft of Wicca to newcomers, this introductory guide presents everything you need to know for successful witchery, including:</p> <ul> <li>An essential set of instructions and guidelines for beginning the practice of the Ancient arts</li> <li>An overview of Wiccan beliefs, laws, rules, and principles</li> <li>Directions for creating and using basic tools of the Craft&#x2015;athame, wand, cup, pentacle, cauldron, broom, black mirror, and meditation</li> <li>Easy-to-follow instructions for altar setup, circle-casting, building power, Deity invocation, and more</li> <li>An assortment of miscellaneous spells, chants, and invocations for a variety of purposes</li> </ul> <p>Walk the path of the Witch-live in harmony and balance, and discover the sacred within the natural world with The Craft.</p></p><p>The first thing Dorothy Morrison hopes to establish in <i>The Craft</i> is what the Craft is not. "It has nothing to do with canned magic, or flying through the air, or snapping lightning from your fingertips," she explains. And no matter how practiced you are, Morrison assures readers it won't give you the power to "turn your enemies into toads so you can set them on the highway." Explaining what the Craft actually is takes more time and thought--both of which Morrison offers in her typically warm, humorous, and concise style throughout this all-inclusive handbook. <p> Wiccans, who are the main practitioners of the Craft, have one overriding commandment, according to Morrison: if it harms no one, do what you will. It is a reminder that every action, thought, and spell has a ripple effect, so be sure that all your work is for the good. This responsible attitude seeps into every page of this practical magic handbook. Expect a highly detailed account of spells, wand skills, sample blessings, altar setups, invocations, and examples of how to use a cup, pentacle, cauldron, and <i>athame</i> (a double-edge knife that should <i>never</i> be used to draw blood). Morrison closes with a Craft calendar, listing celebrations and rituals for every month and season of the year. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Originally from Texas, Dorothy Morrison now lives the magical life in Maine with her family.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Illustrated with over 100 photos and drawings. Roy F. Dunlap&#39;s book is self-described as &#34;a manual of firearms design, construction, alteration and remodeling for amateur and professional gunsmiths and users of modern firearms.&#34; What makes Dunlap&#39;s book important is its specificity. For example, instead of merely bringing up the need for a bench grinder, he cites why a 1/4- o r 1/3-horsepower, double-shaft model, turning at 1,750 rpm with a wire-brush wheel on one side and a medium-coarse wheel on the other is the best choice. He supports his recommendation by explaining why you&#39;ll find wider use for a medium coarse than a finer stone. His chapter entitled &#34;Helpful Gunsmith Knowledge,&#34; is absolutely crammed with bits of information, and includes tips that he evidently could find no other place for in his book. In the midst of a general discussion on disassembly, for instance, Dunlap digresses to describe in detail a L-shaped tool he made to simplify reassembly of an L.C. Smith double and how to use it. All in all, Dunlap covers soldering and brazing; welding; heat treatment of metals; making and fitting sights and accessories; making, fitting and heat treatment of parts; cartridge information useful to gunsmiths; rifle barrels; chamber and barrel work; rifle-action work; pistol and revolver work; shotgun work; twenty two rim fire arms; browning, blueing and blacking of metal; fitting commercial metallic sights; mounting telescopic sights; wood for gun stocks; design of gun stocks; stock making; checkering; stock repair and alteration; stock finishing; styling the custom rifle; custom metal work; ornamentation of wood and metal; target rifles; the Garand rifle; testing facilities and apparatus; synthetic bedding; cartridge and chamber drawings; and data sheets.

To uncover more clues as to why a mysterious assassin is targetting him, Nightwing joins the Haley's Circus tour in order to find more clues and protect those he loves. But as Dick becomes closer acquainted with the big top he grew up with, he discovers there's a much deeper, darker secret to be discovered.</p></p><p><p><b> Author Q&amp;A with Kyle Higgins</b></p> <p> <strong>Q. What's it like working on a huge initiative like <em>The New 52</em>?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>Depending on the day, it's a combination of exciting, inspiring, nerve-wracking, and a whole host of other adjectives (laughs). This past year has been a whirlwind for me. Coming off <em>Gates of Gotham</em> with Scott Snyder, I kind of jumped into the deep end of the pool by launching two New 52 books concurrently (<em>Nightwing</em> and <em>Deathstroke</em>). And, while the spotlight of <em>The New 52 </em>has been intense at times, I'm happy to report that I'm still swimming.</p> <p> <strong>Q. How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> That's actually the most challenging part of all this. With a book like <em>Deathstroke</em>, we moved on from a lot of the continuity that came before. We tried to boil the character down to his core and start fresh. I took the aspects that I liked and expanded on them, crafting a story that&#x2014;in my mind&#x2014;felt new for Slade and also tapped into the angle of respect. He's the older gun that's trying to show the new generation he's still got it.</p> <p> <em>Nightwing</em> has been a bit trickier. Dick Grayson was once Robin, then Nightwing, then Batman, and now Nightwing again. And while we try to stay away from specific instances of old continuity, Dick is a character that exemplifies the idea of change. He's built on it. Our first story, which dives into an aspect of his life that hadn't been explored too much before (the circus and the secrets it might hold) was our way of referencing and paying respect to the old ... while still breaking new ground.</p> <p> <strong>Q. What stories or creators inspire you most when working on your character?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> For Nightwing, I have two big influences: Chuck Dixon and Scott McDaniel's run (1996-2000) and <em>Batman: the Animated Series</em>. Growing up, Chuck and Scott's series was the first book I bought every issue of, month and month out. It's the run that really defined the character for me.</p> <p> As far as <em>Batman: the Animated Series</em> goes, Loren Lester's portrayal of Dick Grayson was also pretty seminal. His is the voice I hear every time I write the character.</p> <p> For <em>Deathstroke</em>, my single favorite moment/portrayal of the character was in Brad Meltzer's <em>Identity Crisis</em>.</p> <p> <strong>Q. So what do you consider to be your character's definitive stories?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Nightwing: Dixon/McDaniel's first 25 issues; <em>Batman the Animated Series</em>: "Robin's Reckoning" and "Old Wounds"; <em>Teen Titans: the Judas Contract. </em>For Deathstroke: <em>Teen Titans: The Judas Contract; DC Universe: Last Will and Testament</em></p> <p> <strong>Q. What have you thought about the response so far for <em>The New 52</em> and your title(s) as whole? </strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Honestly? It's been pretty amazing. The willingness of readers to give these books a chance&#x2014;in particular, my books&#x2014;has been nothing short of fantastic.</p> <p> <strong>Q. Do you keep up with any of the other New 52 books? Which ones and why? </strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> I try to! Scott Snyder's <em>Batman</em>, Josh Fialkov's <em>iVampire</em>, Pete Tomasi's <em>Batman and Robin</em>, Gail Simone's <em>Batgirl</em>, Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato's <em>Flash</em>, Scott Lobdell's <em>Red Hood</em>, Geoff Johns's <em>Aquaman</em> ... the camaraderie that we as creators have built over the past year has made the DC Universe feel like one big family. We all try to support each other.</p> <p> <strong>Q. Has social media and increased direct interaction with DC Comics' fans changed your writing/drawing approach at all in regards to <em>The New 52</em>? </strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Not too much. I try to write stories that I, as a fan, would want to read. That said, I do keep an ear to the ground to see what people are reacting to and what they're not.</p> <p> <strong>Q. What creators have influenced the new direction you've taken with your book?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Scott Snyder has been a big influence. Between his <em>Detective Comics</em> run, our collaboration on <em>Gates of Gotham, and his plan for the Court of Owls</em>, my current take on Dick Grayson has been informed a lot by Scott's work.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Q. So many classic characters have had their looks changed. What has been your favorite character redesign, even if it isn't in your own book?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Supergirl, Batgirl, and the Flash.</p> <p> <strong>Q. There seems to be a lot of storylines integrating both <em>Nightwing</em> and Scott Snyder's <em>Batman</em> title. How in depth is the collaboration process with you and Scott?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p> <strong>A.</strong> Well, Scott is one of my best friends, so a lot of the collaboration happens without us even realizing we're doing it (laughs). Since <em>Gates of Gotham</em>, working together has been pretty effortless&#x2014;we both approach story from the same way. That, coupled with the fact that we're on the phone together a couple times a week and G-Chat all the time, and story conversations just kind of inevitably happen. We just try to keep things fun.</p> <p> <strong>Q. Kyle, you've written Dick Grayson as both Batman (in <em>Batman: Gates of Gotham</em>) and <em>Nightwing</em> now. What differences do you find yourself weaving into the separate personas of Dick?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I think the biggest difference is humor. In <em>Gates</em>, Dick was a bit more stoic than I write him in <em>Nightwing</em>. He wasn't as upbeat and quippy, which I think was a combination of the seriousness of the threat, feelings of insecurity, and the fact that he was wearing the Bat cowl.</p> <p><b>A Look Inside <em>Nightwing</em></b></p> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em>Kyle Higgins is a <i>New York Times</i> Best Selling writer whose work includes<i> Batman: Gates Of Gotham</i>, <i>Supreme Power</i>, and <i>Deathstroke</i>.

And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> from O'Reilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information you'll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices.Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:</p><ul><li>how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system</li><li>how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux</li><li>the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver</li></ul>The new edition of <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> is better than ever. The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.Best of all, you don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book. All you need is an understanding of the C programming language and some background in Unix system calls. And for maximum ease-of-use, the book uses full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware.Today Linux holds fast as the most rapidly growing segment of the computer market and continues to win over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas. With this increasing support, Linux is now absolutely mainstream, and viewed as a solid platform for embedded systems. If you're writing device drivers, you'll want this book. In fact, you'll wonder how drivers are ever written without it.</p><p><p>Jonathan Corbet got his first look at the BSD Unix source back in 1981, when an instructor at the University of Colorado let him "fix" the paging algorithm. He has been digging around inside every system he could get his hands on ever since, working on drivers for VAX, Sun, Ardent, and x86 systems on the way. He got his first Linux system in 1993, and has never looked back.

This buzzword is rooted in a 2,500-year old Chinese philosophy. 'Yang sheng' means to nourish life &#x2013; fostering your own health and wellbeing by nurturing body, mind and spirit. In this book, Katie Brindle teaches readers how to harness this powerful natural healing system to improve every aspect of their life.<br><br>Yang Sheng fits and works brilliantly in modern life. Some of the techniques may seem unusual, but they are all simple, quick and effective. Even more appealing, a key principle of Chinese medicine is balance; that means not being perfect or excluding foods or having too many rules or pushing yourself to exhaustion with overwork or over-exercise. And so, Yang Sheng encourages you to have the green juice and the glass of wine, a full-on day at work and a night out dancing.<br>For people who are overtired and overtaxed, stressed, lacking a sex drive, or who feel anxious or hopeless, the practice of Yang sheng restores balance. Our bodies are designed to self-heal &#x2013; Yang Sheng knows the mechanics of how to activate this.</p><p>Katie Brindle has been a Chinese medicine practitioner since 2002, after graduating from the UK&#39;s Integrated College of Chinese Medicine.

Tolkien's&nbsp;<i>Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;has long been acknowledged as the gold standard for fantasy fiction, and the recent Oscar-winning movie trilogy has brought forth a whole new generation of fans. Many Tolkien enthusiasts, however, are not aware of the profoundly religious dimension of the great Ring saga.<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>The Battle for Middle-earth</i>&nbsp;Fleming Rutledge employs a distinctive technique to uncover the theological currents that lie just under the surface of Tolkien's epic tale. Rutledge believes that the best way to understand this powerful "deep narrative" is to examine the story as it unfolds, preserving some of its original dramatic tension. This deep narrative has not previously been sufficiently analyzed or celebrated. Writing as an enthusiastic but careful reader, Rutledge draws on Tolkien's extensive correspondence to show how biblical and liturgical motifs shape the action. At the heart of the plot lies a rare glimpse of what human freedom really means within the Divine Plan of God.&nbsp;<i>The Battle for Middle-earth</i>&nbsp;surely will, as Rutledge hopes, "give pleasure to those who may already have detected the presence of the sub-narrative, and insight to those who may have missed it on first reading."</p><p>Fleming Rutledge is an Episcopal priest now engaged in a nationwide ministry of preaching and teaching. Her best-selling books have been widely acclaimed across denominational boundaries and have established her reputation as one of America&#39;s finest preachers.<b><i>Christianity &amp; Literature</i></b><br> "If I had to recommend a single work that most completely discloses the theological and moral quality of Tolkien's entire mythological enterprise, I would without hesitation name Fleming Rutledge's&nbsp;<i>The Battle for Middle-earth.</i>"<br><br><b>Ralph C. Wood</b><br> "Fleming Rutledge writes about the moral and theological life of&nbsp;<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;with immense verve and insight. She inhabits the world of Middle-earth from the inside, linking the characters who play out its cosmic drama with the narrative world of Scripture, showing how they have the power both to illuminate our times and to transform our lives."<br><br><b>Thomas H. Luxon</b><br> "Fear not! Fleming Rutledge has carefully avoided reducing Tolkien's thrilling stories to doctrine or his characters to typology. With just the right expository pressure, Rutledge shows how the Tolkien stories we love are woven from the same threads and are concerned with the same questions as the old, old stories of the Bible &#x2014; a book Tolkien loved as no other."<br><br><b>Bradley J. Birzer</b><br> "Rutledge smartly argues that Tolkien's mythology is an immense and intense theological drama, with God at the very center of the plot. And, even if God remains unseen in Middle-earth, He is no more unseen than in our present, postmodern world. Certainly Tolkien had no trouble seeing Him, and, according to Rutledge's excellent book, we shouldn't either &#x2014; in this world or in Middle-earth.

He never went back. But his informal education blossomed on the streets of New York's Upper East Side; as a piano player in the <em>Happy Times Tavern</em>, on the vaudeville circuit of the early 1900's, at all-night poker games in the Algonquin Hotel. This is a racy autobiography by the mute Marx Brother with the rolling eyes, oversized pants and red wig who could send a glissando reeling over his harp. From the financial embarrassment of his childhood generally due to his predatory gambler-brother, Chico, he rose to the free-swinging, free-spending, game-loving gang of the twenties headed articulately by Alec Woollcott. There was croquet at the Woollcott's Vermont retreat, poker at the Algonquin, roulette on the Rivera, and backgammon at the Garden of Allah in Hollywood. At 41 he finally married and dutifully tells the reader in scenario style the conversation and events of his first dates with his wife. It is a chatty, colorful story designed for shockeroos and honks and only gets dull when there are no more pranks to play on anybody. The most appealing parts of Harpo's tale deal with his tour of Russia and his description of his family, particularly his mother Minnie with her Master Plan and Father Frenchie peddling the ""lappas"" (tailor's remnants). It is enjoyable reading and polished writing.&#x201d; Kirkus, 1961</p></p><p></p><h2>Absolute Beauty: Radiant Skin and Inner Harmony Through the Ancient Secrets of Ayurveda</h2><p>We all know absolute beauty when we see it--skin that glows with health and an outer bearing that projects inner tranquillity.

This anthology of Kavan's stories draws together a selection of her best writing from across her long career. Stories from across her collections show the range of her style: oblique and elegiac tales of breakdown and asylum incarceration from Asylum Piece (1940), moving evocations of wartime from I Am Lazarus (1945), fantastic and surrealist pieces from A Bright Green Field (1958), and stories of addiction from Julia and the Bazooka. Her late sci-fi stories will appeal to fans of her last novel, Ice. "Five Days to Countdown," first published in Encounter (1968) and later collected in My Soul in China, is preoccupied with Cold War concerns and the sartorial aesthetics of the 1960s, and, published here for the first time, "Starting a Career" is a futuristic spy thriller, whose protagonist sets out to become the world's greatest enigma.<br><br>Kavan was determined to experiment throughout her writing career, and this collection is moving, funny, bizarre, poignant, often unsettling, but always distinctive and often unique. And even though better known as a writer than an artist, Kavan painted throughout her life; several of her distinctive paintings are included in this collection to illustrate her stories.</p><p><b>Anna Kavan</b> (1901-1968), born Helen Emily Woods, was a British writer and painter. She attended the London Central School of Arts and Crafts during the 1920s, which was also the period in which her heroin use, which continued intermittently until her death, began. In 1940, she began publishing under "Anna Kavan," the name of one of her fictional characters. During this period her writing became darker and more experimental, and her first collection of stories <i>Asylum Piece</i> was well received. She went on to work as a secretary at the literary journal <i>Horizon</i>, where she also contributed stories, articles, and reviews. She became reclusive, struggling with poor health and difficulty in publishing, until 1967, when her best-known novel Ice was published. Kavan died of heart failure the following year.<br><br><b>Victoria Walker</b> is the Chair of the Anna Kavan Society. She teaches in the English Department at Queen Mary, University of London."Few novelists match the fierce intensity of her vision." &#x2014;J.G. Ballard,&nbsp;<i>The Paris Review</i><br><br>"Entering this haunting realm, the reader will crave to plunge deeper into her metallic and poetically surreal universe." &#x2014;Patti Smith<br><br>"It is the cool lucid light of that unique mind which makes her Anna Kavan ... There is nothing else like her writing ... She is one of the most distinctive twentieth-century novelists." &#x2014;Doris Lessing<br><br>"Kavan&#x2019;s talent for extracting an austere beauty from intimations of doom is as compelling here as in so much of her greatly admired work." &#x2014;Rhys Davies<br><br>"If you love J.G. Ballard, you should read Anna Kavan." &#x2014;Chris Power,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"Kavan wrote some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most haunting and original fiction ... To those cultish fans who see Kavan&#x2019;s marginality as central to her glamour, mainstream acceptance may be unwelcome.

For those interested in restoring, preserving, or even re-creating Victorian homes, authentic plans and designs are invaluable.

There are even designs for several store and office fronts, with counters, shelving, etc.<br>Supplementing the large number of complete designs are nearly 700 large-scale drawings of virtually every architectural detail, many embodying the unique "gingerbread" that characterizes Victorian buildings. Included are clear, precise renderings of balusters, brackets, dormers, fireplaces, finials, gables, mantels, moldings, newels, porches, rafters, rosettes, staircases, transoms, verandahs, wainscoting, windows, and hundreds of other features.<br>Restorers of old houses, preservationists, students of American architectural history, admirers of Victoriana, and anyone interested in the Victorian Gothic styles that dominated American domestic architecture in the late 1800s will want to have this inexpensive treasury of authentic century-old plans and details.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>The designs of William T.

Storms is back with a bullet, torn between homicide and souvenirs, cranking up the fevered action as the pot boils over on a street called Lobster Lane. It's reunion time in the Sunshine State, and we're not just talking the family jamboree of the blood-soaked McGraw criminal clan, whose nastiest, meanest member, finally released from prison, is heading south bent on revenge. Serge's drug-addled bud Coleman's here as well, torn between getting hammered and getting more hammered, while trying to construct the biggest bong ever. Meanwhile the government is covering up a growing list of mysterious victims across Florida who may or may not be connected to a nefarious plot being hatched against national security.

He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>Raunchy, raucous, and riotously funny, ATOMIC LOBSTER, as narrated by Oliver Wyman, is a whirlwind of over-the-top comic genius. The story features a psychopath with a twisted sense of humor, Serge A. Storms, and his dopey sidekick, Coleman. This installment turns the duo loose on a cruise ship with a pack of goofy grannies called the "G Unit" and a mysterious CIA agent in search of drugs. The sex is weird and hot, the violence outrageous and funny, so this is not for the younger set. Wyman uses every ounce of his talent for machine-gun pacing and character creation as a panoply of bizarre people parades across the blistering Florida landscape and onto a luxurious ocean liner where anything goes.

What he gets instead is a chorus of noisy birds that constantly wakes him from a sound sleep&#x2014;especially when Koko insists on joining in with his own feline version of birdcalling. But soon Qwill is wondering whether Koko is trying to say more than just &#x201c;tweet tweet,&#x201d; because a series of strange events&#x2014;starting with an act of vandalism and culminating in a mysterious chain of death and disappearance&#x2014;has Pickax in a similar uproar. It seems that this spring, a cat&#x2019;s fancy may turn to crime solving...</p><p>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.More dire doings in Pickax (``400 miles north of everywhere''), where bachelor zillionaire Jim Qwilleran keeps a paternalistic eye on the town from his opulent barn house and his columnist job on Moose County Something, the local paper. Pickax has been saddened by the death of 93-year-old recluse Maude Coggin in a supposedly accidental fire in her decrepit house soon after she'd sold her hundred-acre farm, at a giveaway price, to buyers called Northern Land Improvement. Qwill's suspicions of this deal, reinforced by prescient cats Koko and Yum Yum, lead to his finding the company nonexistent. Some big-time chicanery is afoot, not to mention other odd happenings: a break-in and theft at the recently opened art center; an old scandal new to Qwill; the misgivings of boutique owner Elizabeth Hart about her boyfriend Derek's being offered a job as manager of Chet's Barbecuea downscale bar owned by town councilman Chet Ramsbottom. And then there's young butterfly-breeder Phoebe Sloan, whose unsavory boyfriend Jake is bartender at Chet's. When the town's major annual event takes placeit's a spelling beePhoebe is missing from her team. With help from Qwill and, of course, Koko and Yum Yum, the discovery of her body in Bloody Creek brings about the downfall of Pickax's corrupting elements. Braun's terminally arch mixture (The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, 1997, etc.) is even more extreme than before as confusion reigns, characters proliferate, and Qwill, with his second-sighted assistants, once more solves Pickax's problems. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This masterpiece of political philosophy was widely read throughout Europe, attracted an especially enthusiastic readership in England, and had a profound effect on the framers of the American Constitution. Montesquieu (1689-1755), already famous and controversial through his Persian Letters, a work of his youth in which he humorously satirized the foibles of French society, turned in his later years to this serious treatise on the nature of law. But though the subject itself was profound, this gravitas did not inhibit the famous Montesquieu wit. Master of the pithy bon mot, he managed to survey a great deal of political and philosophical territory while keeping his readers charmed with memorable and artfully turned phrases. &#34;Liberty,&#34; he says, &#34;consists in the ability to do what one ought to desire and in not being forced to do what one ought not to desire.&#34; Concerning the unpopularity of the English in France, he says it is due to their arrogance, which is such that even in peace &#34;they seem to negotiate with none but enemies.&#34;The scope of this masterful work is truly prodigious. Montesquieu explores the essentials of good government; compares and contrasts despotism, monarchy, and democracy; and discusses the factors that lead to corruption of governments. Among the many other topics considered are education of the citizenry, crime and punishment, abuse of power and of liberty, individual rights, taxation, slavery, the role of women, the influence of climate on the temper of a people and their form of government, commerce, religion, and a host of additional subjects.The Spirit of Laws is essential and genuinely enjoyable reading for anyone interested in the development of democracy.</p><p><b>CHARLES-LOUIS DE SECONDAT</b>, the jurist and political philosopher, was born at the Ch�teau de La Brede, near Bordeaux, France, on January 18, 1689. He attended the Oratorian College of Juilly and then studied law in Bordeaux from 1705 to 1708.&nbsp;Upon his father's death in 1713, he assumed the title of baron de La Brede and was appointed counselor of the Bordeaux parliament (1714). In 1716 he inherited his uncle's title of baron de Montesquieu, and also his office, serving as the deputy president of the parliament from 1716 to 1726.<br><br>Montesquieu's first major work, <i>Lettres persanes </i>(Persian Letters), was published in 1721 and became a huge success. Supposedly written by two Persian travelers in Europe, Montesquieu satirized French institutions. In 1725 he published <i>Le Temple de Gnide </i>(The Temple of Gnide).<br><br>Because of the success of <i>Persian Letters, </i>in 1728 Montesquieu was elected to the French Academy, the French lit�erary academy established by Cardinal de Richelieu in 1634 to maintain standards of literary taste and to establish the lit�erary language. That same year, seeking to complete his education by foreign travel, he set out on a grand tour of Europe, particularly England, where he remained from 1729 to 1731.<br><br> In 1734 Montesquieu published <i>Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur et de la decadence des Romains </i>(Thoughts on the Causes of the Greatness and the Downfall of the Romans), one of the first important works in the philos�ophy of history.&nbsp;<br><br>Montesquieu's greatest work, <i>De l'esprit des lois </i>(The Spirit of Laws), was published in 1748. It is a comparative study of three types of government: republic, monarchy, and despotism. Montesquieu held that governmental powers should be separated and balanced to guarantee individual rights and freedom. Attacked by the French clergy and his enemies at the Sorbonne, Montesquieu responded with <i>D�fense&nbsp;de "l'esprit des lois" </i>(Defense of "The Spirit of Laws") in 1750. His last work, <i>Essai sur le gout </i>(Essay on Taste) was not completed.<br>&nbsp; <br>Montesquieu died in Paris on February 10, 1755.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)</h2><p><b>The first Harper Connelly mystery from #1 <i>New York</i> Times bestselling author Charlaine Harris!</b><br><br> Harper Connelly has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people.

Writing at the height of his career, Rand articulated in his slender volume the pioneering vision that all design should seamlessly integrate form and function. This facsimile edition preserves Rand's original 1947 essay with the adjustments he made to its text and imagery for a revised printing in 1970, and adds only an informative and inspiring new foreword by design luminary Michael Bierut.

He was a master at arriving at designs that boiled down the essence of the intended messages, be it an advertisement or a corporate identity, and he similarly renders out the heart of basic design philosophy in this book.&#34; - BoingBoing</p><h2>Oxford German Dictionary</h2><p>The <em>Oxford German Dictionary</em> provides authoritative coverage of German and English with over 320,000 words and phrases, and 520,000 translations.

He took part in the Persian Wars and his epitaph, said to have been written by himself, represents him as fighting at Marathon. At some time in his life he appears to have been prosecuted for divulging the Eleusinian mysteries, but he apparently proved himself innocent. Aeschylus wrote more than seventy plays, of which seven have survived: <b>The Suppliants</b>, <b>The Persians</b>,<b> Seven Against Thebes</b>, <b>Prometheus Bound</b>, <b>Agamemnon</b>, <b>The Choephori</b>, and <b><b>The Eumenides</b></b>. (All are translated for Penguin Classics.) He visited Syracuse more than once at the invitation of Hieron I and he died at Gela in Sicily in 456 BC. Aeschylus was recognized as a classic writer soon after his death, and special privileges were decreed for his plays.<br><br><b>Euripides</b>, the youngest of the three great Athenian playwrights, was born around 485 BC of a family of good standing. He first competed in the dramatic festivals in 455 BC, coming only third; his record of success in the tragic competitions is lower than that of either Aeschylus or Sophocles. There is a tradition that he was unpopular, even a recluse; we are told that he composed poetry in a cave by the sea, near Salamis. What is clear from contemporary evidence, however, is that audiences were fascinated by his innovative and often disturbing dramas. His work was controversial already in his lifetime, and he himself was regarded as a &#x2018;clever&#x2019; poet, associated with philosophers and other intellectuals. Towards the end of his life he went to live at the court of Archelaus, king of Macedon. It was during his time there that he wrote what many consider his greates work, the <b><b>Bacchae</b></b>. When news of his death reached Athens in early 406 BC, Sophocles appeared publicly in mourning for him. Euripides is thought to have written about ninety-two plays, of which seventeen tragedies and one satyr-play are known survive; the other play which is attributed to him, the <b><b>Rhesus</b></b>, may in fact be by a later hand.<br><b><br>Sophocles</b> was born at Colonus, just outside Athens, in 496 BC, and lived ninety years. His long life spanned the rise and decline of the Athenian Empire; he was a friend of Pericles, and though not an active politician he held several public offices, both military and civil. The leader of a literary circle and friend of Herodotus, he was interested in poetic theory as well as practice, and he wrote a prose treatise <b>On the Chorus</b>. He seems to have been content to spend all his life at Athens, and is said to have refused several invitations to royal courts.<p>Sophocles first won a prize for tragic drama in 468, defeating the veteran Aeschylus. He wrote over a hundred plays for the Athenian theater, and is said to have come first in twenty-four contests. Only seven of his tragedies are now extant, these being <b>Ajax</b>, <b>Antigone</b>, <b>Oedipus the King</b>, <b>Women of Trachis</b>, <b>Electra</b>, <b>Philoctetes</b>, and the posthumous <b>Oedipus at Colonus</b>. A substantial part of <b>The Searches</b>, a satyr play, was recovered from papyri in Egypt in modern times. Fragments of other plays remain, showing that he drew on a wide range of themes; he also introduced the innovation of a third actor in his tragedies. He died in 406 BC.<br><br><b>E.F. Watling</b> was educated at Christ's Hospital and University College, Oxford. His translations of Greek and Roman plays for the Penguin Classics include the seven plays of Sophocles, nine plays of Plautus, and a selection of the tragedies of Seneca.</p></p><h2>A Sacred Voice Is Calling: Personal Vocation and Social Conscience</h2><p>What does it mean to find and follow our personal calling?

Thousands flocked to mourn the best recognized and loved man of nineteenth-century England. His books had made them laugh, shown them the squalor and greed of English life, and also the power of personal virtue and the strength of ordinary people. In his last years Dickens drew adoring crowds to his public appearances, had met presidents and princes, and had amassed a fortune.</p><p>Like a hero from his novels, Dickens trod a hard path to greatness. Born into a modest middle-class family, his young life was overturned when his profligate father was sent to debtors' prison and Dickens was forced into harsh and humiliating factory work. Yet through these early setbacks he developed his remarkable eye for all that was absurd, tragic, and redemptive in London life. He set out to succeed, and with extraordinary speed and energy made himself into the greatest English novelist of the century.</p><p>Years later Dickens's daughter wrote to the author George Bernard Shaw, "If you could make the public understand that my father was not a joyous, jocose gentleman walking about the world with a plum pudding and a bowl of punch, you would greatly oblige me." Seen as the public champion of household harmony, Dickens tore his own life apart, betraying, deceiving, and breaking with friends and family while he pursued an obsessive love affair.</p><p><i>Charles Dickens: A Life</i> gives full measure to Dickens's heroic stature-his huge virtues both as a writer and as a human being- while observing his failings in both respects with an unblinking eye. Renowned literary biographer Claire Tomalin crafts a story worthy of Dickens's own pen, a comedy that turns to tragedy as the very qualities that made him great-his indomitable energy, boldness, imagination, and showmanship-finally destroyed him. The man who emerges is one of extraordinary contradictions, whose vices and virtues were intertwined as surely as his life and his art.</p></p><p><b>Claire Tomalin</b> is the author of eight highly acclaimed biographies including <i>Thomas Hardy and Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self</i>, which won the 2002 Whitbread Book of the Year Award. She has previously won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Biography, the Whitbread First Novel Award, the Hawthornden Prize, the NCR Book Award for Non-Fiction, and the Whitbread Biography Award."As Claire Tomalin demonstrates in her <b>vivid and moving new biography</b>, Dickens&#x2019;s own life was rich in the attributes we call &#x201c;Dickensian&#x201d; &#x2014; shameless melodrama, gargantuan appetites, reversals of fortune... To encompass this frenzy, Tomalin keeps the story racing. She brings Dickens to life in all his maddening contradictions... <b>Dickens walks off the page, and the pace never flags.</b> Tomalin accomplishes this resurrection in a mere 417 pages of text, supplemented by dozens of illustrations, several maps of Dickens&#x2019;s London and a helpful dramatis personae... <b>if you plan to read only one biography of the most popular Victorian writer, it should be this one."</b><br><b>--THE WASHINGTON POST </b><br><b><br>"Enormously ambitious... admirable... warmly sympathetic and often eloquent." </b><br><b>--Joyce Carol Oates, THE&nbsp;NEW&nbsp;YORK&nbsp;REVIEW&nbsp;OF&nbsp;BOOK</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;Clear-eyed, sympathetic and scholarly</b>, she spreads the whole canvas, alive with incident and detail, with places and people.

And then she saw him, across the street, ducking behind an old gray Volvo in the thick Las Vegas Strip traffic. He looked thin in his baggy jeans and his loose-hanging dark blue shirt. She couldn&#x2019;t see his face&#x2014;he wore dark sunglasses and a Giants baseball cap.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t fair. She&#x2019;d just landed a six-month stint here at the Mandalay in a Beatles musical retrospective, hoping for half a year of peace and calm without a stalker to tie her stomach in knots, but here he was, after only four days. She&#x2019;d been so careful when the taxi picked her up at her cottage in Malibu nearly a week before&#x2014;had the driver drop her off at LAX, a terminal away from the airline she&#x2019;d booked&#x2014;but still he was here, watching her, following her. All she&#x2019;d wanted was her life to return to normal. She&#x2019;d done everything she could. She&#x2019;d gone to the cops to see if they could stop him. Movie star stalkers were old hat to the Calabasas Sheriff&#x2019;s Department, responsible for handling all the criminal problems in Malibu. They had a protocol in place, a pleasant older cop had told her four months before, they would talk to him if she would point him out. What, she&#x2019;d asked, would her stalker do when he got tired of following her around? Attack her? The friendly older cop only shook his head, avoided answering that question. That same day, Missy bought a Becker Ka-Bar knife, a fixed blade three and a quarter inches long, with a three-inch handle. It was made of Cro-Van steel, the salesman had told her, and was favored by sailors going back nearly to the ark. She liked the sound of that, carrying something badass enough for the marines. She liked the feel of the Ka-Bar, too, solid, and ready to go in its sheath hooked onto her waistband.<br> <br>The cops hadn&#x2019;t caught the stalker, even following their protocol.<br> <br>She kept fluffing, touched on some lip gloss, and continued to stare into the window. She didn&#x2019;t see him now, but she knew he was there, watching. She was so used to feeling acid burning her gut, so used to the overwhelming urge to run as fast as she could, that she didn&#x2019;t at first recognize the bolt of rage that splashed through her. She felt her adrenaline spike, felt her blood pumping hard and fast, the mad mix making her shake. For the first time she let the heat of anger wash over her, and she saw clearly who and what he was&#x2014;nothing. She wasn&#x2019;t going to let him destroy her life. Not anymore. She turned on her heel and worked her way through the gridlock traffic on the Strip, not even aware of the horns honking, the tourists jostling her or the wolf whistles. All her focus was on that miserable little man who probably spent his nights licking her publicity photos.<br> <br>She saw him straighten, stare at her, then draw back when she started running toward him, not away, her Ka-Bar in her hand.<br> <br>She heard growling, realized it was from her, and yelled, &#x201c;You miserable little worm! I&#x2019;m going to carve out your tonsils!&#x201d; He sprinted away, Missy after him, running fast and strong. She&#x2019;d been a blimp in high school, but all that had changed when she&#x2019;d turned twenty. Six years later, she was in top-flight shape, ran three miles every single day, worked out at Sam&#x2019;s Muscle Bar, in L.A. Catch him? Not a problem. He wove through crowds of tourists on the sidewalk, knocking some out of his way, going around others, and Missy followed in his wake, closing in on him. He ran past the Venetian hotel with its Grand Canal and gondolas floating past, knocking two people aside, leaving them cursing after him. When the crush of tourists became too thick, she ran in the street, close to the sidewalk, and gained on him more. When he turned right, toward the Wynn hotel and looked back over his shoulder, she saw it clear as day&#x2014;fear. He&#x2019;s afraid of me! It was heady to see that look after so many months of aggravation and, yes, fear. Now it was his turn. She felt fierce, unstoppable. She amped up her speed.<br> <br>He was tiring fast as he ran into the huge hotel garage, nearly empty this time of day, Missy on his heels. She lost him for a moment in the shadows, then spotted him running across to the far side of the garage that opened onto the gardens of the Wynn. She was nearly on him now. Without hesitating, Missy took a flying leap and landed on his back, wrapping her arms around his neck. He fell forward under her weight, half on the grass, half on the concrete garage floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;You move, and I&#x2019;ll slice off your ear!&#x201d; She pricked his neck with her Ka-Bar, enough to draw a drop of blood, to show him she was serious. He became still as a stone. So he wasn&#x2019;t a complete moron. She jerked off his ball cap, grabbed a tangle of brown hair, and pulled his head back. She elbowed off his sunglasses and looked down into a thin, good-looking face, marred by some acne scars on his forehead, and pale brown eyes filled with fear. Of her. Of her Ka-Bar digging into his neck. He didn&#x2019;t outweigh her by more than twenty pounds. She felt triumphant; she&#x2019;d brought him down, and not a cop in sight. Missy leaned close, thought about biting him but didn&#x2019;t. She whispered in his ear, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s scared now, aren&#x2019;t you, you creep? Who are you? Why have you been stalking me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about. I never saw you before in my life. You started ch-chasing me and I-I saw the knife. I ran.&#x201d; His voice was high, twitchy, with a bit of a stutter that pleased her immensely.<br> <br>&#x201c;You puking little liar!&#x201d; She jerked up his head by the hair, dug the knife a bit deeper. He groaned, music to her ears.<br> <br>A man&#x2019;s deep voice from just above her said quietly, easily, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t carve him up here, ma&#x2019;am. Mr. Wynn wouldn&#x2019;t be pleased. I&#x2019;m Del Conroy, head of security.&#x201d;<br> <br>Missy stilled, craned her neck to look up into a hard face, at odds with that smooth cowboy voice. He was older, with iron-gray hair cut short, a white shirt and slacks. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t stop me, Mr. Conroy. I&#x2019;m Missy. Missy Devereaux. I want to carve him up, but I won&#x2019;t if he tells me why he&#x2019;s been stalking me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A stalker? And you brought him down. Well done.&#x201d; He squatted down beside her. &#x201c;Nice to meet you, Missy. And what&#x2019;s your name, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do anything. She attacked me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Conroy studied the young man&#x2019;s face, spotted the midwestern accent, stood. &#x201c;Up you go, Missy, I&#x2019;ve got this now, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; And he scooped her up beneath her armpits and set her on her feet. Both of them stared down at the man, who was rubbing his neck. Missy saw the smear of blood from her Ka-Bar and smiled.<br> <br>Conroy said in the same calm, soothing voice, &#x201c;I suggest you don&#x2019;t move or I&#x2019;ll let her cut your ears off.&#x201d; He turned back to Missy, who was still breathing fast and hard, not from all the running, but from the adrenaline rush. &#x201c;Talk to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Missy&#x2019;s foot was raised to slam down on his back if he moved. The urge to kick him was nearly overpowering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Talk to me,&#x201d; Conroy said again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Phew, well, okay. Like I said, this out-of-shape worm is a stalker, been lurking around corners for months, even followed me here from L.A.&#x201d; And Missy couldn&#x2019;t stop herself, she kicked him, not very hard at all, really, since she wasn&#x2019;t in her boots, only sneakers.<br> <br>He lurched to the side, hugging himself, and yelled, &#x201c;You saw what she did. I&#x2019;m going to have her arrested; I&#x2019;m going to press charges. I didn&#x2019;t do anything. I was walking down the Strip, minding my own, and she starts screaming at me and waving that knife! I want you to call the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>Del Conroy, a retired cop himself and head of security at the Wynn for three years now, knew that very probably nothing was going to happen to this guy, and hated it. He said politely, &#x201c;Sir, again, what is your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Blinker&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s my nickname&#x2014;I&#x2019;m John Bayley. I have a good job. I&#x2019;m a fine citizen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why does anyone call you Blinker?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a bond trader. I&#x2019;m fast, I can make a trade in the blink of an eye.&#x201d;<br> <br>A bond trader who was a stalker? That was a new one, even to Conroy. He said, &#x201c;Please give me your wallet, Mr. Bayley.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man pulled out a butt-flat alligator wallet, good quality, Conroy saw, and handed it to him. A California driver&#x2019;s license, three credit cards, an AAA card, a gym membership for Fit Bods in Santa Monica, a couple of hundred-dollar bills. &#x201c;You want to tell me what you&#x2019;re doing here in Las Vegas, Mr. Bayley?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just like the other hundred thousand mutts wandering the streets out there, I&#x2019;m here to unwind from the high-stress job I&#x2019;ve got&#x2014;see shows, play some machines&#x2014;until this crazy girl came after me with a knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re thirty-two.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Let me up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conroy memorized the address in Santa Monica and gave Mr. Bayley back his wallet. &#x201c;Get up, Mr. Bayley. We&#x2019;ll go back to my office and call the police.&#x201d; Del Conroy prayed the guy had prior charges, or he&#x2019;d get off without a doubt.<br> <br>Missy became vaguely aware of people&#x2019;s hushed voices and looked up to see a good dozen bystanders watching the little drama. She slipped the knife back into her pocket, tossed her head until her beautiful hair swirled and danced, and gave them a huge wave. &#x201c;Come see me sing at the Mandalay tonight! I&#x2019;m in The Beatles Retrospective.&#x201d; She turned, shook Del Conroy&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Thank you for keeping me from sticking my knife in this pervert&#x2019;s neck. But I wanted to, I really did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, but you didn&#x2019;t. You did good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do anything! It&#x2019;s you who&#x2019;s going to jail!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Be quiet, Mr. Bayley,&#x201d; Del Conroy said. He turned to Missy. &#x201c;Keep that Ka-Bar in its sheath, Ms. Devereaux. You don&#x2019;t want the cops to see it. How&#x2019;d you get it through airport security?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bought it here, at Larry&#x2019;s Pawn Shop. Why would the cops care? I was defending myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Better to play it smart. With Mr. Bayley ranting how you sliced him up, they&#x2019;ll probably take it anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Well, that didn&#x2019;t sound right. Missy eyed her stalker. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over now, anyway, you pervert. I know who you are and I&#x2019;ll soon be free of you. You&#x2019;re going to leave me alone or you&#x2019;ll be going to jail for a good long time. And me? I&#x2019;ll be normal again.&#x201d; She felt so very fine she started to sing her favorite song, &#x201c;Twist and Shout.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</h2><p>No one description will fit this strange, eccentric, endlessly complex masterpiece.

Tristram ShandyIntroduction and Notes by Robert Folkenflik <p>Rich in playful double entendres, digressions, formal oddities, and typographical experiments, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman provoked a literary sensation when it first appeared in England in a series of volumes from 1759 to 1767. An ingeniously structured novel (about writing a novel) that fascinates like a verbal game of chess, "Tristram Shandy is the most protean and playful English novel of the eighteenth century and a celebration of the art of fiction; its inventiveness anticipates the work of Joyce, Rushdie, and Fuentes in our own century. This Modern Library Paperback is set from the nine-volume first edition from 1759.</p></p><h2>Spock&#39;s World</h2><p>Relates the story of the enigmatic Mr. Spock and his mysterious home of Vulcan, now threatened by a mysterious crisis</p><p>On the planet Vulcan, a crisis of unprecedented proportion has caused the convocation of the planet's ruling council -- and summoned the <i>U.S.S.

He&#x2019;s authored thirty-seven&nbsp;novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.House of the Rising Sun <br><br> <br>THE SUN HAD just crested on the horizon like a misplaced planet, swollen and molten and red, lighting a landscape that seemed sculpted out of clay and soft stone and marked by the fossilized tracks of animals with no names, when a tall barefoot man wearing little more than rags dropped his horse&#x2019;s reins and eased himself off the horse&#x2019;s back and worked his way down an embankment into a riverbed chained with pools of water that glimmered as brightly as blood in the sunrise. The sand was the color of cinnamon and spiked with green grass and felt cool on his feet, even though they were bruised and threaded with lesions that were probably infected. He got to his knees and wiped the bugs off the water and cupped it to his mouth with both hands, then washed his face in it and pushed his long hair out of his eyes. His skin was striped with dirt, his trousers streaked with salt from the dried sweat of the horse. For an instant he thought he saw his reflection in the surface of the pool. No, that was not he, he told himself. The narrow face and the shoulder-length hair and the eyes that were like cups of darkness belonged on a tray or perhaps to a crusader knight left to the mercies of Saracens.<br> <br>&#x201c;�Venga!&#x201d; he said to the horse. &#x201c;You have to be instructed to drink? It is no compliment to me that the only horse I could steal is probably the dumbest in Pancho Villa&#x2019;s army, a horse that didn&#x2019;t even have the courtesy to wear a saddle.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse made no reply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or is stupidity not the problem?&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Do you simply consider me an ogre to be feared and avoided? Either way, my sensibilities are fragile right now, and I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you would get your sorry ass down here.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the horse came down the embankment and began to drink, the man, whose name was Hackberry Holland, sat on a rock and placed his feet in a pool, shutting his eyes, breathing through his nose in the silence. It was a strange place indeed, one the Creator had shaped and beveled and backdropped with mountains that resembled sharks&#x2019; teeth, then had put away for purposes he did not disclose. There was no birdsong, no willow trees swelling with wind, no tinkle of cowbells, no windmill clanking to life, the spout drumming water into a galvanized tank. This was a feral land, its energies as raw and ravenous as a giant predator that ingested the naive and incautious, a place closer to hell than to heaven.<br> <br>He longed for a firearm and a canteen sloshing with water and a tall-crown hat and a pair of boots and soft socks and a clean shirt. It was not a lot to ask. Death was bad only when it was degrading, when it caught you sick and alone and lying on sheets soiled with your smell, your fears assembling around you like specters in the darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You see those two strings of smoke up on that mountain?&#x201d; he said to the horse. &#x201c;I suspect those are cook fires built by your former owners. Or by banditos that got no use for gringos from Texas. That means we&#x2019;re going to have to cross those mountains north of us, and other than the grass growing in this sand, there&#x2019;s probably not a cupful of feed between here and the Rio Grande. You think you&#x2019;re up to that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He rested his palms on his knees. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So I guess the big question is: What are we going to do? The answer is: I got no idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stared at the water rippling across the tops of his feet. A great weariness seemed to seep through his body, not unlike a pernicious opiate that told him it was time to rest and not quarrel with his fate. But death was not supposed to come like this, he told himself again. His fingernails were rimmed with dirt, his belt taken from him by his captors, his toes blackened with blood where they had been systematically stomped. He looked up at the sky. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re already circling,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll take me first, then they&#x2019;ll get to you, poor horse, whether you&#x2019;re breathing or not. I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s worked out this way. You didn&#x2019;t do nothing wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse lifted his head, ears forward, skin wrinkling from a blowfly that had lit on his rump.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Hackberry said.<br> <br>Then he turned his face to a breeze blowing down a slope not more than a hundred yards away. No, it wasn&#x2019;t simply a breeze. It smelled of mist and trees, perhaps pines, and thunderheads forming a lid above canyon walls. It smelled of cave air and fresh water and flowers that bloomed only at night; it smelled of paradise in a mountain desert. &#x201c;You reckon we found Valhalla? It&#x2019;s either that or I&#x2019;m losing my mind, because I hear music. You think you can make the climb up there, old pal?&#x201d;<br> <br>This time Hackberry didn&#x2019;t wait for a response. He picked up the horse&#x2019;s reins and led him up the embankment on the far side of the riverbed, convinced that his deliverance was at hand.<br> <br>HE WORKED THE horse up the incline through the entrance of the canyon and followed a trail around a bend scattered with fallen stone. A paintless one-story Victorian house, with a wide veranda and cupolas on the corners and fruit trees and two cisterns in back, was perched on a grassy bench with the voice of Enrico Caruso coming from a gramophone inside. The incongruity of the scene did not end there. A hearse, outfitted with brass carriage lamps and scrolled with paintings of white and green lilies and drawn by four white horses, was parked in front. There were red sores the size of quarters under the animals&#x2019; harnesses.<br> <br>At least a dozen horses were tethered to a rail, and others were picketed in the side yard. Some of the horses wore United States Army saddles. Beer and tequila bottles had been broken on the rocks along the trail that led to the yard. Just as the wind picked up, Hackberry&#x2019;s horse spooked sideways, walleyed, pitching his head against the reins.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, boy,&#x201d; Hackberry said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve probably ridden into a straddle house, although I must admit that hearse is a little out of the ordinary.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse&#x2019;s nostrils were dilated, ears back. Hackberry dismounted and walked him up the grade, trying to see inside the hearse. Someone had restarted the recording. He could see no one through the windows. Directly above, the clouds had turned a shade of yellow that was almost sulfurous. The wind was cooler and blowing harder, creating a sound in the trees like water rushing through a riverbed. He seemed to have wandered into a magical place that had nothing to do with its surroundings. But he knew, just as the horse did, that sentiments of this kind about Mexico had no credibility and served no purpose. The campesinos were kept poor and uneducated; the police were corrupt; and the aristocracy was possessed of the same arrogance and cruelty that had given the world the Inquisition. Anyone who believed otherwise invited the black arts of both the savage and the imperialist into his life.<br> <br>He gave up on the hearse. The trees in the rear of the house had thick, dark green, waxy leaves and were shadowed by the canyon&#x2019;s walls. But something was wrong with the image, something that didn&#x2019;t fit with the ambiance that Gauguin would have tried to catch with his oils. Hackberry closed and opened and wiped his eyes to make sure his hunger and dysentery had not impaired his vision or released images that he kept walled away in his mind. No, there was no mistaking what had transpired in the canyon lidded by yellow clouds that seemed to billow like thick curds from a chemical factory. Four black men in army uniforms, two of them with their trousers pulled to their ankles, all of them in their socks, their hands bound behind them, had been hanged from the tree limbs, each dying on a separate tree, as though someone had used their death as part of an ornamental display.<br> <br>Hackberry turned the horse in a circle and began leading it back down the slope.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, hombre! �A d�nde vas?&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice said.<br> <br>A Mexican soldier in a khaki uniform had stepped out on the porch. He was thin and sun-browned and wore a stiff cap with a black bill and a gun belt he had cinched tightly into the flaps of his jacket. He had a narrow face and pits in his skin and teeth that were long and wide-set and the color of decayed wood. &#x201c;You look like a gringo, man,&#x201d; the soldier said. &#x201c;�No hablas espa�ol?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hackberry gazed idly around the yard. &#x201c;I cain&#x2019;t even habla ingl�s,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least not too good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a funny man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d; Hackberry paused and squinted innocuously at the sky. &#x201c;What is this place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know a casa de citas when you see one? How do you like what has been hung in the trees back there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mind my own business and don&#x2019;t study on other people&#x2019;s grief.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know you got a Mexican brand on your horse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I found him out in the desert. If you know the owner, maybe I can give him back. Can you tell me where I am?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to know where you are? You are in a big pile of shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why. I don&#x2019;t see myself as much of a threat to nobody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw you looking at the hearse. You bothered by corpses, man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Coffins and the like make me uneasy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a big liar, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those are hurtful words, unkind and unfair, particularly to a man in my circumstances. I&#x2019;d feel better if you would put that gun back in its holster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to hold my gun, man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, cain&#x2019;t say as I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll give you the chance. Maybe you might beg to hold my gun. You get what I&#x2019;m saying, gringo?&#x201d; The officer&#x2019;s mouth had become lascivious.<br> <br>Hackberry stared at the figures suspended in the trees up the slope, at the way the limbs creaked and the figures swayed like shadows when the wind gusted. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d those colored soldiers do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did they do? They cried like children. What you think, man? What would you do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably the same. Tell you what. I cain&#x2019;t pay for food, but I&#x2019;ll chop wood for it. I&#x2019;d like to feed my horse, too. Then I&#x2019;d like to be on my way and forget anything I saw here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Mexican officer took a toothpick from his shirt pocket and put it in his mouth. His hair was black and thick and shiny and bunched out from under his hat. &#x201c;Some Texas Rangers attacked one of our trains and killed a lot of our people. You heard about that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hackberry glanced up at the clouds that were roiling like smoke. He rubbed the back of his neck as though he had a crick in it, his pale blue eyes empty. &#x201c;What would provoke them to do such a thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d tell you to ask them. But they&#x2019;re all dead. Except one. He got away. A tall man. Like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I still cain&#x2019;t figure why you hung those colored soldiers. Y&#x2019;all don&#x2019;t let them use your cathouses?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You ever seen dead people tied on car fenders? Tied on like deer full of holes? Americans did that in the village I come from. I saw it, gringo.&#x201d; The Mexican soldier drew down the skin below his right eye to emphasize the authenticity of his statement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never heard of that one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a tall gringo, even without boots. If we hang you up, you&#x2019;re gonna barely touch the ground. You&#x2019;re gonna take a long time dying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s my bad luck. Before you do that to me, maybe you can he&#x2019;p me out on something. Those soldiers back there were members of the Tenth or Eleventh Cavalry.

First Jesse heads south for a brutal confrontation with the demons from his past--a trio of white trash psychos, including Jesse&#39;s monstrous grandmother. The Jesse and company go west, only to crash a party of Babylonian proportions.</p><p>In and of itself, the story of a man with one foot in Heaven and one foot in Hell is hardly original. But in the hands of Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon, the story of Jesse Custer becomes a blasphemous masterpiece seething with originality. Custer is a former Texas minister who was joined with a spiritual being called "Genesis." Now Custer is on a journey to find God, but not in the traditional enlightenment sense. I mean track Him down and give Him a piece of his mind. Along for the journey are his gun-friendly girlfriend and his Irish punk vampire buddy. <i>Until the End of the World</i> starts with a flashback to Jesse's childhood, when he watched his father get shot in the head. That kicks off "All in the Family," the first of two stories in this collection. The second story, "Hunters," features the character Jesus de Sade. Yes, even if you've known for years how hip and cool comics are, you won't believe you're reading something this outrageous. And as Kevin Smith points out in his introduction, this is one book "that actually surpasses its hype." <i>--Jim Pascoe</i></p><h2>Interventions: Evidence-Based Behavioral Strategies for Individual Students</h2><p>This book was originally published in 1993.

G. Jung, as rendered by Jung's official translator. "The Undiscovered Self" (1957) integrates many of Jung's lifelong social and psychological concerns and addresses the uneasy relation between the individual and mass society. The survival of civilization, he maintains, depends on individual awareness of both the conscious and unconscious aspects of the human psyche. The exploration of the unconscious, in particular, leads to self-knowledge and with it recognition of the duality of human natureits potential for evil as well as for good. Jung believes that it is this self-knowledge that enables the individual to resist the collective power of mass society and the state and to cope with their possible threats. Jung's reflections on self-knowledge and the exploration of the unconscious carry over into his essay "Symbols and the Interpretation of Dreams," completed shortly before his death in 1961. (It is the original version of his introduction to the symposium Man and His Symbols, conceived as a popular presentation of Jungian ideas.) Describing dreams as communications from the unconscious--as expressions of aspects of the individual that have been neglected or unrealized--Jung explains how the symbols that occur in dreams compensate for repressed emotions and intuitions. In a world dehumanized, in Jung's view, by scientific "progress" and the loss of emotional participation in natural events, symbols recall our original nature, its instincts and peculiar way of thinking. This essay brings together Jung's fully evolved thoughts on the analysis of dreams and the healing of the rift between consciousness and the unconscious, in the context of his system of psychology.</p></p><p><b>Sonu Shamdasani</b> is editor of <i>The Red Book</i> and Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge: A Desk Reference for the Curious Mind</h2><p><p>A COMPLETE REVISION AND THOROUGH UPDATING OF THE ULTIMATE REFERENCE FROM THE NEWSPAPER OF RECORD. </p><p>A comprehensive guide offering insight and clarity on a broad range of even more essential subjects. </p><p>Whether you are researching the history of Western art, investigating an obscure medical test, following current environmental trends, studying Shakespeare, brushing up on your crossword and Sudoku skills, or simply looking for a deeper understanding of the world, this book is for you.

Forensic anthropologists know them intimately, can read in them stories of brief or long lives and use them to reconstruct every kind of violent end. 206 Bones opens with Tempe regaining consciousness and discovering that she is in some kind of very small, very dark, very cold enclosed space. She is bound, hands to feet. Who wants Tempe dead, or at least out of the way, and why? Tempe begins slowly to reconstruct...</p><p>Tempe and Lieutenant Ryan had accompanied the recently discovered remains of a missing heiress from Montreal to the Chicago morgue. Suddenly, Tempe was accused of mishandling the autopsy -- and the case. Someone made an incriminating phone call. Within hours, the one man with information about the call was dead. Back in Montreal, the corpse of a second elderly woman was found in the woods, and then a third.</p><p>Seamlessly weaving between Tempe's present-tense terror as she's held captive and her memory of the cases of these murdered women, Reichs conveys the incredible devastation that would occur if a forensic colleague sabotaged work in the lab. The chemistry between Tempe and Ryan intensifies as this complex, riveting tale unfolds. Reichs is writing at the top of her game.</p><p><b>Unabridged Compact Disk Includes a Bonus MP3 CD of Kathy Reichs' <i>Deja Dead</i></b></p></p><p>Kathy Reichs, like her character Temperance Brennan, is a forensic anthropologist, formerly for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in North Carolina and currently for the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de m�decine l�gale for the province of Quebec.

There is a vast concentration of land holdings by private parties or government, which has a negative effect on both the morale and morals of the people. It fails to adapt to new challenges, whether they be economic, political, social, or climatic conditions. Raw materials are used up at home and have to be imported, but can no longer be afforded. There is a concentration of power and decision making in the hands of the powerful few. The traditional, classic family becomes fractured. There is exploding knowledge and increased complexity the results in each subsequent generation knowing less of the country&#39;s total cultural heritage then the generation that went before it. Overwhelming population numbers hinder individual development and achievement. The least capable members of society outbreed the more capable. Women and minorities&#39; rights become pervasive issues. Laws strangle the productive members of a society and the judicial system is slow, inefficient and subjective. Belief in the occult increases. Sexual freedom is pervasive. Inflation is rampant. People become disinterested and disenchanted in the political processes. The population&#39;s primary focus in on self-gratification and entertainment. World cities arise. Governments and societies emphasize preservation, duplication, security and mass-production. The more capable member of society rejected government service for selfish reasons, believing they can maintain their separate self-interests. Drug use and homosexuality become widespread.

Everyone in the sleepy Scottish town of Lochdubh adores elderly Mrs. Gentle - everyone but Hamish Macbeth, that is. Hamish thinks the gentle lady is quite sly and vicious, and the citizens of Lochdubh think he is overly cranky. Perhaps it's time for him to get married, they say.<br><br>But who has time for marriage when there's a murder to be solved? When Mrs. Gentle dies under mysterious circumstances, the town is shocked and outraged. Chief Detective Inspector Blair suspects members of her family, but Hamish Macbeth thinks there's more to the story, and begins investigating the truth behind this lady's gentle exterior.</p><p>M.C. Beaton lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. In addition to the Hamish Macbeth series, she writes the Agatha Raisin mystery series.Poor Hamish Macbeth has so many battles to fight at one time. First, his beloved police station is, again, in danger of closing. Second, he's the only one suspicious of village newcomer Mrs. Gentle. Third, once more he's thinking about getting engaged. Narrator Graeme Malcolm is splendid; every character is distinctive with his skilled delivery. He's excellent in his portrayal of Macbeth's chief inspector's self-important rantings, the Russian prostitute and the policewoman who comes seeking her, and, of course, the horrible Mrs. Gentle. Hamish remains his bumbling, unassuming self as he solves a murder with the help of whiskey-soaked Jimmy Anderson. This is an outstanding installment in Beaton's delightful series, and Malcolm makes a sparkling story even better.

Intended as a guide for overcoming the designs of the dark warriors, and a blueprint for achieving the absolute freedom that is our true birthright as the super race of the realm, this provocative book brilliantly integrates into a larger schema such issues as media manipulation, racism, dark forces, crop circles, our food and water, and imminent extraterrestrial contacts, with the cosmic unfolding of human awareness and the evolutionary activation of our complex DNA codes&#x2014;our blueprint to immortality.</p><p>This, the third book of the trilogy, the Sirian Revelations, is information that is of the utmost relevance to this difficult moment in the human experience. <p>If you are struggling to understand why current events are playing out as they are in the global theater or puzzled over the future of humankind and our great planet, it will help you put the pieces together, to find your answers and empower you to act upon them. </p><p>It is a revealer of the secrets held by the dark forces, while it is a celebration of the light that shines from the human race, as we move through our fear and hopelessness and reclaim the power, paving the way for our clear passage through the desert days...into the light. </p><p>There is no room for fear now. </p><p>There is no room for rage - useless emotions that hold us in servitude to those who wish to control the human race. </p><p>Are you ready to lift the veil forever?</p>Patricia Cori is a highly regarded clairvoyant/channel and the founder of the LightWorks Association, a spiritual center and New Age library in Rome.

How thorough would your investigation be? How many hard-hitting questions would you ask? How carefully would you consult with top experts to get detailed, accurate answers? Lee Strobel knows firsthand. It was as an award-winning reporter for the Chicago Tribune and an avowed atheist that he first investigated the greatest news story of all -- the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Now, in The Case for Christ, he presents compelling evidence and expert testimony for the claims of Christianity. As a seasoned journalist with a Yale law background, Strobel systematically tracks down his leads and asks the blunt, tough questions you would want to ask -- questions that can make or break the Christian faith. He refuses contrived, simplistic answers. Instead, he pieces together hard facts through interviews with a dozen of the country&#39;s top scholars. Written in the style of a blockbuster investigative report, The Case for Christ is a provocative and spellbinding read, marshaling expert testimony and persuasive evidence. With unerring instincts, Strobel ferrets out: Historical evidence: Do we possess reliable documents concerning the life, teachings, and resurrection of Jesus? Scientific Evidence: Is there archaeological substantiation for the historical accounts about Jesus? Did Jesus perform miracles? Psychiatric Evidence: Did Jesus really claim to be God? What evidence is there that he fits God&#39;s profile? Fingerprint Evidence: What does prophecy have to say about Jesus? Other Evidence: Jesus&#39; death, the missing body, eyewitness accounts, and claims of personal encounters. The Case for Christ reads like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But, it&#39;s not fiction. It&#39;s a riveting journey to the truth about the most remarkable event in history: the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. And it&#39;s a revealing, personal testimony to his power to transform people yet today -- even the most case-hardened, cynical journalist.</p><p><i>The Case for Christ</i> records Lee Strobel's attempt to "determine if there's credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God." The book consists primarily of interviews between Strobel (a former legal editor at the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and biblical scholars such as Bruce Metzger. Each interview is based on a simple question, concerning historical evidence (for example, "Can the Biographies of Jesus Be Trusted?"), scientific evidence, ("Does Archaeology Confirm or Contradict Jesus' Biographies?"), and "psychiatric evidence" ("Was Jesus Crazy When He Claimed to Be the Son of God?"). Together, these interviews compose a case brief defending Jesus' divinity, and urging readers to reach a verdict of their own.A Seasoned Journalist Chases Down the Leads in the Biggest News Story in History</p><h2>RV Repair &amp; Maintenance Manual [New &amp; Updated]</h2><p>Covers electrical, gas, water, heating, cooling, and sanitation systems, appliances, trailer brakes, towing, hitches, and interior care</p><p></p><h2>The Promise: An Elvis Cole and Joe Pike Novel</h2><p><b>Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are joined by&nbsp;<i>Suspect</i>&nbsp;heroes LAPD K-9 Officer Scott James and his German shepherd, Maggie, in this heart-stopping thriller from #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Robert Crais.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>Elvis Cole and Joe Pike keep their promises.

She was small, round, &nbsp;and dumpy. The fringed leather jacket probably made her seem rounder, &nbsp;but she&#x2019;d never been a looker. &nbsp;She reminded &nbsp;Mr. Rollins of an overripe peach, and the peach was clearly afraid.<br> A steady rain fell from the overcast night. The dingy, one-bedroom bungalow west of Echo Park reeked of bleach and ammonia, but the windows &nbsp;were closed, the shades were &nbsp;down, and the doors were locked. A single yellow twenty-five-watt lamp provided the only light. The chemical smell gave Mr. Rollins &nbsp;a headache, but he could not open the windows. They were screwed shut.<br> Rollins wasn&#x2019;t his real name, but the man and the woman probably weren&#x2019;t using their true names, either. Amy and Charles. Amy hadn&#x2019;t &nbsp;said three words since they arrived. Charles did the talking and Charles was getting impatient.<br>&#x201c;How long does this take?&#x201d;<br> The chemist&#x2019;s answer was resentful.<br> &#x201c;Two minutes, &nbsp;dude. Relax. Science takes time.&#x201d;<br> The chemist was a juiced-up, sleeved-out rock pile hunched over the coffee table. A hiker&#x2019;s LED headlamp blazed on his forehead. He was heating the contents of a glass jar with a small torch while watching two meters &nbsp;that looked like swollen &nbsp;TV remotes. Rollins had found him cooking &nbsp;meth &nbsp;eight years ago and used him often.<br> Charles &nbsp;was a trim man in his forties with neat brown hair and the tight build of a tennis player. Mr. Rollins had made three buys off Charles in the past year, and all had gone well. This was why Mr. Rollins let him bring the woman, &nbsp;only now, seeing her, Rollins wondered why she wanted to come. She damned near pissed herself when Rol- lins searched her and made them put on the gloves. He made everyone who entered the house wear vinyl gloves. Rollins did not allow food or drinks. No one could chew gum or smoke cigarettes. The list was pretty long. Mr. Rollins had rules.<br> He smiled as he adjusted &nbsp;his gloves.<br> &#x201c;They make your hands sweat, don&#x2019;t they, Amy? I know it&#x2019;s a pain, but we&#x2019;re almost finished.&#x201d;<br> Charles answered for her.<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine. Tell your man to finish up so we can get out of here.&#x201d; The chemist mumbled without looking up.<br> &#x201c;Fuck off.&#x201d;<br> Rollins smiled at Amy again and glanced at the round plastic container beside the chemist. It was filled with a material that looked like yogurt and felt like modeling clay.<br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get this?&#x201d;<br> Charles stepped on her answer again. &#x201c;I told you where we got it.&#x201d;<br> Rollins considered pushing his pistol up Charles&#x2019;s ass and popping a cap, but he did not let his feelings show.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just making conversation. Amy seems nervous.&#x201d; Charles glanced at Amy.<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> Amy&#x2019;s voice was whisper-soft when she finally &nbsp;spoke. &#x201c;I made it.&#x201d;<br> The chemist snorted. &#x201c;Yeah. Right.&#x201d;<br> Then the chemist sat up and gazed at Rollins.<br> &#x201c;Whoever made it did a righteous job. It&#x2019;s the real deal, brother.&#x201d; Charles crossed his arms. Smug.<br> &#x201c;You see?&#x201d;<br> Rollins was impressed. The material in the Tupperware was not easy to come by. Charles claimed the woman had two hundred kilo- grams.<br> &#x201c;What about tags?&#x201d;<br> The chemist turned off the torch and unplugged the meters. &#x201c;Ethylene test shows zero. I&#x2019;ll know parts per million when I run&nbsp;a sample at home, but the stuff is clean, bro. No tags. Untraceable.&#x201d; Rollins thanked the chemist, who packed his equipment into a&nbsp;green backpack and let himself out through the kitchen. A light win- ter shower pattered the roof.<br> Charles said, &#x201c;So now what? Are we in business?&#x201d; Rollins &nbsp;sealed the lid on the Tupperware.<br> &#x201c;The buyer will test it himself. If his results are the same, we&#x2019;re golden.&#x201d;<br> Amy spoke again and this time she sounded anxious.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make more for the right buyer. I can make all they want.&#x201d; Charles took her arm, trying to turn her away.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see their money first.&#x201d; Amy did not move.<br> &#x201c;I have to meet them, you know. That&#x2019;s a requirement.&#x201d; &#x201c;Not now.&#x201d;<br> Charles steered her toward the front door like a shopping &nbsp;cart. Rollins quickly stopped them.<br> &#x201c;Back door, Charles. Never the front.&#x201d;<br> Charles swung &nbsp;the woman around and aimed her toward &nbsp;the kitchen. After insisting she come, Charles couldn&#x2019;t get her out of the house fast enough.<br> Rollins opened the back door and asked for their gloves. He gave&nbsp;Amy a gentle smile.<br> &#x201c;Buyers don&#x2019;t like to be met, but they&#x2019;ll make an exception for you, Amy. I promise.&#x201d;<br> She seemed ready to cry, but Charles pulled her out and they dis- appeared into the rain.<br> Rollins locked the kitchen door and hurried &nbsp;to the front door, where he peered through &nbsp;a peephole. When Charles and Amy reached the street, he returned to the kitchen and opened the back door to air the place out. The tiny backyard was dark and hidden from neighbors by overgrown bushes and a sprawling &nbsp;avocado tree.<br> Rollins stood in the door breathing air that didn&#x2019;t stink of ammo- nia and called his buyer.<br> &#x201c;Good news.&#x201d;<br> A coded way of saying the tests were positive. &#x201c;Very good. I will send someone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tonight.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes. Now.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You have the other things here, too. I&#x2019;ve told you for a week to come get this stuff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am sending someone.&#x201d; &#x201c;I want it gone. All of it.&#x201d; &#x201c;He will take it.&#x201d;<br> Rollins put the Tupperware in the bedroom with the other things and returned to the kitchen. He still wore his gloves and would wear them until he left. He took a one-liter spray bottle from beneath the sink and sprayed bleach on the kitchen counters and floor and door. He sprayed the coffee table where the chemist had done his work and the stool on which the chemist had sat. He sprayed the living room floor and the doorjamb between the kitchen and living room. Rollins believed the bleach would destroy the enzymes and oils left in fingerprints or spit and erase DNA evidence. He wasn&#x2019;t convinced this was true, but it seemed sensible, so he bleached out the house whenever he used it.<br> When Mr. Rollins acquired the house, he made several changes to better serve his needs, like screwing shut the windows and installing peepholes. Nothing &nbsp;fancy, nothing &nbsp;expensive, and nothing &nbsp;to attract the neighbors&#x2019; attention, none of whom knew him, had met him or, hopefully, seen him. &nbsp;Rollins did only enough maintenance &nbsp;to prevent the house from becoming an eyesore. He let people stay from time to time, never anyone he personally knew and only long enough so the neighbors would think the house was a rental. &nbsp;Mr. Rollins had not built a fortress when he acquired the house, just a place of relative safety from which to do his crime.<br> Rollins put away the bleach, returned &nbsp;to the living room, and turned off the lamp. He sat in the darkness, nose burning &nbsp;as he lis- tened to the rain.<br> 9:42 p.m.<br> 2142 hours.<br> 1742 Zulu Time.<br> Mr. Rollins hated to wait, but there was big money at stake if Charles and Amy were real. Rollins wondered if Charles beat her. He seemed like the type. &nbsp;She seemed like the type, too. Rollins&#x2019;s older sister married &nbsp;a man who abused her for years until &nbsp;Rollins &nbsp;killed &nbsp;him.<br> Rollins checked the time again.<br> 9:51.<br> Rollins put his pistol on the couch. He rested his hand on the gun, checked the time, and closed his eyes.<br> 9:53.<br> The rain stopped.<br> 10:14.<br> Someone knocked at the front door.<br> Rollins jerked to his feet and moved quickly into the kitchen. The buyer&#x2019;s man would &nbsp;never use the front door. That was a rule. Every- one used the back.<br> Rollins quietly &nbsp;closed and locked the kitchen door as knocking came from the front.<br> Knock knock knock.<br> Rollins slipped off his shoes and hurried &nbsp;to the front. Knock knock knock.<br> Mr. Rollins peered through &nbsp;the peephole and saw an adult male in a dark rain shell. The hood was back and the unzipped shell exposed a loud patterned shirt. Average height, Anglo, dark hair. The man pressed the bell, but the bell didn&#x2019;t work, so he knocked again.<br> Rollins &nbsp;held his pistol &nbsp;close as he watched.<br> The man waited a few seconds and finally &nbsp;walked&nbsp; away.<br> Rollins watched for another two minutes. Cars passed and a cou- ple went by huddled beneath an umbrella even though &nbsp;the rain no longer fell. The world appeared normal, &nbsp;but a siren wailed in the dis- tance. Rollins had a bad feeling.<br>10:32.<br> Rollins phoned the buyer again.<br> &#x201c;The person you sent, he knows to go to the back?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes. Of course. He has been there before.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;If you sent someone, he didn&#x2019;t show.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hold on. I will find out.&#x201d;<br> A second siren was screaming. Closer. The man&#x2019;s voice returned.<br> &#x201c;He should have been there. This is not right.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m jammed up here, man. I want to leave.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Bring the material to me. Not here. Someone will meet you by<br> MacArthur Park, there on the northeast corner.&#x201d;<br> Rollins felt a flash of anger, but kept his voice cool. Rollins had made a fortune &nbsp;off this man and stood to make more.<br> &#x201c;You know the rules, Eli. I&#x2019;m not driving around with your things in my car. Come get this crap.&#x201d;<br> Rollins was pocketing his phone when he heard a wet crunch in the yard and pounding on the back door.<br> Rollins hurried to the kitchen,&nbsp; checked the peephole, and saw a face he recognized. Carlos, Caesar, something &nbsp;like that. His eyes were bright and he was breathing hard when Rollins opened the door.<br> Rollins scratched gloves from his pocket. &#x201c;Put on the gloves, you idiot.&#x201d;<br> Carlos ignored the gloves and ran to the living room, trailing mud and grass. He peeked out the nearest window, &nbsp;bare fingers touching the shade. A helicopter passed overhead &nbsp;so low the little house shook. &#x201c;Fuck your gloves. You hear that? The police are on me, bro. Ain&#x2019;t<br> this fuckin&#x2019; cool? I smoked their blue ass!&#x201d;<br> The helicopter rumbled away, but circled the area.<br> Rollins felt a burst &nbsp;of fear. Thoughts of mud, grass, and fingerprints on the shade vanished. He touched &nbsp;aside the shade and saw a blazing searchlight sweep the next street.<br> &#x201c;You brought the police.&#x201d; Carlos turned away, laughing.<br> &#x201c;I lost them, bro. I could be anywhere.&#x201d;<br> Rollins felt as if his head were filling with angry maggots. The helicopter orbited overhead, lighting up the shades. The chop of the rotor moved away and slowly circled.<br> &#x201c;How the fuck did this happen?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They made my face. I got warrants, y&#x2019;know? Relax.&#x201d;<br> Carlos flopped onto the couch, giggling, wired on adrenaline and chemicals. His muddy &nbsp;shoes were on the cushions.<br> &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know where I am. They gonna roll over us and keep right on rollin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> Rollins &nbsp;gathered his thoughts. The house &nbsp;was now lost. The goods in the bedroom were history. The mud and the grass no longer mattered. Rollins could not allow himself to be found here with the material in the bedroom and this giggling idiot on the couch. Rollins accepted these facts and the acceptance brought &nbsp;calm.<br> The pistol was no good to him now. Rollins returned to the cabi- net where he kept the bleach and took out a rusted, &nbsp;fourteen-inch pipe wrench. The wrench easily weighed three or four pounds.<br> Carlos was still stretched on the couch when Mr. Rollins went back to the living room. He strode directly to Carlos without &nbsp;saying a word and brought the wrench down hard. He felt the head go on the first blow, but gave it two more. Rollins dropped the wrench and put on a fresh &nbsp;pair of gloves. He pressed the pistol into Carlos&#x2019;s hands, both hands so it would look like Carlos had handled the gun, and dropped it beside the wrench. If Rollins was picked up, he did not want a gun in his possession.<br>The helicopter &nbsp;passed again. The shades flashed &nbsp;into blinding white rectangles and once more filled with black.<br> Rollins trotted to the front door and looked through the peep- hole. A police officer &nbsp;passed on the sidewalk &nbsp;and another &nbsp;spoke with people across the street. Rollins &nbsp;closed his eyes. He took slow, mea- sured &nbsp;breaths &nbsp;as he counted to one hundred. He put his eye to the peephole again. The policemen were gone.<br> Rollins returned to the kitchen. He wore a dark sport coat and slacks. There would be blood splatter, but the blood would be difficult to see at night on the dark fabric. He had a nylon rain shell, but de- cided not to put it on. The sport coat was better. The police were looking for a young Latin guy in a black T-shirt, &nbsp;not an older, well- dressed Anglo. &nbsp;His car was several blocks away. If Rollins could get away from the house and beyond the police perimeter, he still might survive.<br> The light returned and slid away again.<br> Rollins moved in the moment of darkness. He opened the kitchen door, peeled off his gloves, and stepped out. A cop and a German shepherd were in the backyard. The dog was a deep-chested brute with angry eyes and fangs like daggers. The cop shouted as the dog charged.</p><h2>How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot [For the Beetle, Bus, Karmann Ghia, SquareFastback Safari and 411 - 412]</h2><p>Manual to keep your Volkswagen running to it&#39;s full potential.</p><p></p><h2>Back to Eden: American herbs for pleasure and health : natural nutrition with recipes and instruction for living the Edenic life</h2><p>Old fashioned, time-tested good health advice - back to Eden.

But now, with the aid of high-speed computers, scientists have been able to penetrate a reality that is changing the way we perceive the universe. Their findings -- the basis for chaos theory -- represent one of the most exciting scientific pursuits of our time.</p><p> No better introduction to this find could be found than John Briggs and F. David Peat's <em>Turbulent Mirror.</em> Together, they explore the many faces of chaos and reveal how its law direct most of the processes of everyday life and how it appears that everything in the universe is interconnected -- discovering an "emerging science of wholeness."</p><p> <em>Turbulent Mirror</em> introduces us to the scientists involved in study this endlessly strange field; to the theories that are turning our perception of the world on its head; and to the discoveries in mathematics, biology, and physics that are heralding a revolution more profound than the one responsible for producing the atomic bomb. With practical applications ranging from the control of traffic flow and the development of artifical intelligence to the treatment of heart attacks and schizophrenia, chaos promises to be an increasingly rewarding area of inquiry -- of interest to everyone.</p></p><p><p>John Briggs, Ph.D., is a professor of English and the journalism coordinator at Western Connecticut State University. He lives in Danbury, Connecticut. </p><p>F. David Peat holds a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Liverpool and has written dozens of books on art, science, and spirituality. He lives in London and can be reached at www.fdavidpeat.com. They are the authors of <em>Turbulent Mirror.</em></p>Unlike James Gleick's Chaos: Making a New Science ( LJ 8/87), which focused heavily on mathematics, Briggs and Peat look at how chaos theory--the idea that turbulent phenomena actually contain organizing patterns--has also influenced other scientific disciplines, offering a model, for example, for understanding the human brain and developing computer systems for artificial intelligence. The book's chapter heading quotations from Chinese Taoist texts and Alice in Wonderland are clues that readers are being led into abstruse territory. But encouraging readers to appreciate nuances of truth rather than to seek a reductionist version of truth may be what chaos theory--and this book--is all about.

Dallas Willard presents a way of living that enables ordinary men and women to join with God and realize their highest aspirations of well-being and -doing. The key to this self-transformation resides in the practice of the spiritual disciplines. Willard explains why the disciplines work and how their practice affirms human life to the fullest. <p><i>The Spirit of the Disciplines</i> places solitude and silence, prayer, simple and sacrificial living, meditation upon God's word and ways, and service to others at the heart of the gospel. "We need a deeper insight into our <i>practical</i> relationship to God in redemption," Willard writes. "We need an understanding that can guide us into constant interaction with the Kingdom of God." Speaking to what Willard identifies as "a widespread and deep longing among Christians and non-Christians alike for the personal purity and power to live as our hearts tell us we should," the observation of the disciplines can make the process of deepening and revitalizing our relationship with God a part of daily existence. </p><p>"We can increasingly resemble Christ in character and in power by following him in his overall style of life," Willard affirms. "This was the method of his earliest disciples, and it is as valid today as it was then...To enter into and increasingly master such a life is what having faith in Christ really means." To enter into the spirit and practice of the disciplines is to move toward the authentic life of faith. <i>The Spirit of the Disciplines</i> is an intelligent, thoughtful guide to an enriched spiritual life, a book about how to live as Christ lived, directed to those who hope to be his disciples in deed as well as intention. It details why the disciplines are essential to our deliverance from the concrete power of sin, and outlines the ways they can help each of us achieve the blessings of the companionship of Christ.</p>Dallas Willard, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is a professor at the School of Philosophy at the University of Southern California.</p><h2>The Explicit Gospel - Member Book</h2><p><p><b>The Explicit Gospel - Member Book</b> provides six weeks of Bible study content, learning activities, and group experiences.

That frequently the gospel is not taught in evangelical congregations is both disquieting and surprising.

Yet it is easy to dismiss plants as the silent witnesses to our progress on the planet. The world nurtures between 250,000 and 300,000 types of flowering plants and they can seem like a pretty backcloth to our remorseless activity: walking a dog through a forest of quiet oaks; driving a car past purple fields of lavender; riding the train across a prairie of wheat.</p> <p>PLANTS AND PEOPLE</p> <p>In reality, plants have played a dynamic role in shaping our history. Life on Earth is made possible by the very breath of plants, by the way they absorb carbon dioxide (C02) and exhale oxygen. Plants may have even paved the way for us, evolving the process of photosynthesis in response to some prehistoric climate catastrophe and opening the DNA gates for the evolution of terrestrial animals like ourselves. </p> <p>Grains of pollen frozen beneath the Antarctic ice may yet reveal the secrets of our Earth's own past. They could help predict its future too, solving the puzzle over whether the current hole in the ozone layer, attributed to our use of fossil fuels, was prefigured millions of years ago. Plant history is certainly longer than ours. While plants have been colonizing the planet for 470 million years, our own timeline is huddled into a relatively recent past. If every century counted as a minute on the face of a clock, the Romans conquered Europe twenty minutes ago; Christianity was founded less than a quarter of an hour back; and the first white people only settled in America in the time it takes to turn the beans of <i>Coffea arabica</i> into a decent cup of coffee.</p> <p>Plants have always provided us with fuel, food, shelter, and medicines. They have always controlled the rate of land erosion and regulated the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air that we breathe. They have given us the fossil fuels that we are consuming with such profligacy and they have inspired us to build national botanical gardens, to go garden visiting, and to spend small for tunes on cultivating our own back yard plant collections.</p> <p>We have self-harmed on plants too, overeating sugar, dosing up on natural narcotics, over indulging in alcohol. An overweight Durban housewife might rue the day that sugar (p.166) was first refined; an inebriate in Adelaide might blame his sorrows on barley (p.104), while some poor patient in a Cincinnati cancer ward could hold tobacco (p.136) responsible for his condition. On the other hand, we can rejoice in a cup of tea (p.26), celebrate with a glass of wine (see Wine Grape, p.202) or simply drink in the scent of the sweet pea (p.118) and the rose (p.162). </p> <p>FRAGILE EARTH</p> <p>This is a good time to look at how plants have altered the history of our life on Earth and how they continue to play a pivotal role. We are taking liberties with our plants and, in doing so, with planet Earth. It cannot continue. By consuming the fossil fuels that were made from plants and destroying the plants that make up the rainforests we are, according to the paleoclimatology scientist Professor David Beerling, "undertaking a global uncontrolled experiment guaranteed to alter the climate for future generations. Plants . . . are a major factor in the environmental drama of global warming now as they have been in the recent and more distant past" (<i>The Emerald Planet</i>, 2007).

But if you look closely at the trajectories that your life has taken, you may notice the results of similar gravitational effects from the people you have known. Sometimes people around us cause massive swings in direction and speed that can propel us on toward new and undiscovered territory and experiences. That&#x2019;s what happened with me and the space-exploration mission known as <i>Voyager</i>.</p><p>The trajectory of my life has been guided by the slow, gentle, persistent gravitational pull of two elegant robotic spacecraft and the teams of people&#x2014;scientists, engineers, mentors, students&#x2014;who made their missions of exploration so marvelously compelling. Taking advantage of a rare celestial alignment of the planets, those two robots, <i>Voyager 1</i> and <i>Voyager 2</i>, gave us all our first detailed, high-resolution, glorious views of the solar system beyond Mars, revealing the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and their panoply of rings and moons, in all their awesome wonder&#x2014;not just for scientists, but also for poets, musicians, painters, novelists, moviemakers, historians, and even kids.</p><p>I happened to have been born at a time that placed me in college and graduate school right when the fruits of that fortuitous celestial alignment were ripening. By a random turn of a corner in a building, while walking back from class, I spotted a flyer from a professor who was looking for student research help. I soon found myself <i>involved</i> in the missions of these extraordinary projections of human technology&#x2014;something I had dreamed of since I could barely read. I felt as if I had been cast out into deep space myself, seeing my life, and my world, from a completely new perspective.

Just think of these sophisticated creations&#x2014;mere machines, yet projections of ourselves&#x2014;launched into my hero Carl Sagan&#x2019;s &#x201c;shallow depths of the cosmic ocean,&#x201d; representing the integrated abilities, hopes, dreams, and fears of the more than 100 billion people who have lived on planet Earth and who, like me, have wondered, &#x201c;Are we alone?&#x201d; &#x201c;What else is out there?&#x201d; &#x201c;What is our destiny?&#x201d;</p><p>These Voyagers&#x2014;and by that I mean the people as well as the machines&#x2014;have taken us all on a tour of the Greatest Hits of the Solar System, and we have all been privileged passengers carried along for the ride. Along the way, I went from a starry-eyed kid interested in astronomy and planetary science to a student learning the ropes from some of the greatest masters in the field, to&#x2014;now&#x2014;a practitioner of the art myself, with students of my own. It has been an adventure filled with astounding beauty, discovering new worlds so exotic that their alien landscapes were entirely unanticipated, facing unprecedented challenges, meeting and then saying good-bye to new friends and colleagues.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And now the <i>Voyagers</i> are leaving the protective bubble of our sun and crossing over into the uncharted territory between the stars. They&#x2014;and we, through them&#x2014;are now interstellar travelers. Via their technology, their discoveries, and the messages that they are delivering to the galaxy on our behalf, we have all entered the Interstellar Age. This may be the ultimate legacy of the men and women and machines of <i>Voyager. </i>As we learn and grow as a species, as we begin to grasp the fragility of our existence and the fleeting nature of habitable environments in our solar system, we must adapt and move on. In the long run&#x2014;the <i>very</i> long run&#x2014;we will have to leave our sun&#x2019;s cradle and move out into the stars. The Interstellar Age is the inevitable future of humankind, and the <i>Voyagers</i> are our first baby steps along that path.</p><p>I want to share that story with you here and convey, I hope, how special it has been to be witness to what historians of the future will no doubt regard as some of the most incredible voyages of exploration ever attempted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part One</p><p>ALIGNMENT</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Voyagers</p><p>I GAZED IN wonder at the graceful and swirling azure clouds of Neptune. I had impulsively boarded the spacecraft in 1977, at the age of twelve, seeking a place where the gravity of my world would be but a distant memory. Word of the launch came on the evening news. &#x201c;A Grand Tour of the Solar System!&#x201d; the announcer proclaimed. Two launches would carry our band of travelers destined for Jupiter and Saturn, and if all went well, we would forge on, perhaps past Uranus and Neptune&#x2014;worlds as yet unexplored. The thought of running away from home to explore some distant land tugged at me, as it did for many preteens. In the world of my small Rhode Island town, even traveling to another area code may as well have been like traveling to Mars. Of course, it could only ever be a dream: traveling faster than any rocket had ever gone, taking two years to Jupiter, three years to Saturn, Uranus by the mid-&#x2019;80s, Neptune by my twenty-fourth birthday&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It sounds like science fiction, but this is essentially a true story. The spaceships are called <i>Voyager 1 </i>and <i>Voyager 2</i>, and they really did launch in 1977. While the <i>Voyagers</i> don&#x2019;t carry humans on board, they do carry our eyes and ears, our most sophisticated cognitive intelligence, our science and art and dreams. In 1977 they brought me out of that sheltered world of childhood and into a fantastic new world of learning, culture, and Big Science, first as a college student at Caltech in Pasadena, then as a graduate student in Hawaii. <i>Voyager</i>&#x2019;s story of exploration parallels my own. Indeed, the missions have touched countless lives and careers in space science and engineering&#x2014;so many of the people I know and have worked with over the decades feel as if the <i>Voyagers</i> propelled their lives<i>.</i></p><p>The &#x201c;Grand Tour&#x201d; announced that day in 1977 would take advantage of a once-every-176-year planetary alignment that provided an opportunity to send a single spacecraft past <i>all four</i> giant outer solar system planets, using the gravity of one to slingshot the mission on a path to the next, bouncing it from one remarkable world to another, and then eventually completely out of our solar system. The last time such an alignment occurred, back in the eighteenth century, the frontier of exploration was defined by European wooden sailing ships.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Voyager 1 </i><b>and </b><i>2</i><b> Trajectories.</b> Schematic diagram of the trajectories that enabled NASA&#x2019;s twin <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft to tour the four gas giant planets and achieve the velocity to escape our solar system. <i>(NASA/JPL)</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>The twelve-year-old me had become hopelessly hooked on space exploration watching the adventures of the <i>Apollo</i> astronauts on the moon. My parents tell me that they woke me up on that Sunday night in July of 1969 to witness Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make history on live TV in the Sea of Tranquility. We saved the Monday MAN ON MOON! giant headlined copy of the Providence <i>Evening Bulletin</i>, which I later had framed. For the next three and a half years, I was glued to the television, whenever possible, watching these guys walking&#x2014;and <i>driving cars!</i>&#x2014;on the lunar surface. While I was assured by the voices of NASA engineers and space commentators that it was hard work, many of the astronauts seemed like they were having fun. I want to do <i>that</i>, I thought. I dressed as an astronaut for a long run of Halloweens.</p><p>I followed the exploits of the twin <i>Viking</i> landers sent to the surface of Mars in 1976. Even though people weren&#x2019;t going, the idea of sending two car-sized robots on a 150-million-mile remote-control journey and getting them to set down, softly, onto the surface of the Red Planet was astounding. In the decades ahead I would witness firsthand even crazier Mars landing systems as the <i>Mars Pathfinder </i>and <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Opportunity </i>rover mission set down on Mars&#x2014;successfully&#x2014;using bouncing airbags, and the larger <i>Curiosity</i> rover did so using its Rube Goldberg&#x2013;like &#x201c;sky crane&#x201d; landing system. <i>Viking</i> used old-school technology, like parachutes and retro-rockets, right out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon. While Marvin the Martian wasn&#x2019;t waiting there for us, the Mars that was revealed by the <i>Vikings </i>turned out to be eerily like deserts on Earth, though much dustier, colder, and drier.</p><p>The early 1970s-era cameras on <i>Viking</i> were essentially faxing their photos back to Earth, and NASA was using what was then brand-new electronic imaging technology that needed no photographic film. Instead, it converted the sunlight reflected off of a Martian scene into radio signals, beaming them back to Earth, where the faint signals were picked up by radio telescopes the size of a baseball field. I saw the digital images these faint signals produced revealed on the nightly news. The first images came down live, and painstakingly slow&#x2014;one column of picture elements or &#x201c;pixels&#x201d; at a time. Space photography! I want to do <i>that</i>, too, I thought. My parents and grandparents helped me buy a telescope and some attachments to link it up to my 35mm camera.</p><p>These days it&#x2019;s hard to explain to my kids, or to my students, what it was like growing up thirsty for science in the 1970s and 1980s. Imagine a world, I implore them, where there are only three major TV networks plus another run by the government, called the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS. Imagine further that for the most part only the government channel would have science shows on TV (not counting <i>Star Trek</i>&#x2014;one of my favorites, to be sure, but only partly &#x201c;science&#x201d;). For the most part, science TV was dominated at the time by <i>NOVA</i>&#x2014;the educational and beautifully produced show from Boston&#x2019;s WGBH station that is still running strong today. But that was basically it: no Science Channel, Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel, NASA TV, History Channel, or for that matter, no Fox, CNN, MTV, VCRs, DVRs, and <i>no way to skip the commercials. </i>They look at me in horror, as if I had to endure being raised by wolves in the frozen tundra. Then they shoot me a truly pitiful look when I remind them that, worse yet, we had no Internet. Gads! How did we survive?!</p><p>In that bleak landscape of science communication was the TV show <i>Cosmos</i>, which first aired on PBS in 1980. The show&#x2019;s host, the astronomer, planetary scientist, astrobiologist, <i>Voyager</i> imaging team member, and science popularizer Carl Sagan, was probably the first scientist I had ever encountered who spoke English. I mean common English, more like what you&#x2019;d hear around the dinner table than the jargon and shorthand codes that most scientists typically use when talking about their work. But that plain talk was also laced with metaphor and analogy and evocatively grand cadences, often accompanied by the soaring and romantic electronic music of Vangelis. Sagan revealed the mysteries of the planets and moons and asteroids and comets and stars and galaxies and where we came from and where we&#x2019;re going. I found myself <i>listening to him</i> and falling in love with the idea of doing science, of possibly even becoming a scientist. It was a captivating, mind-blowing, entertaining glimpse into the modern world of astronomy and space exploration. I would eagerly await each week&#x2019;s new episode, talking about it endlessly the next day with my nerd friends at school, mimicking Sagan&#x2019;s distinct, guttural staccato voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;Perhaps, one day, we will sail among the stars on gossamer beams of light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; My mother loved his turtleneck and tweed jacket (I would get to introduce her to him many years later, at a professional conference we both attended in Rhode Island. We were both just starstruck, but Carl was kind, warm, and thoroughly approachable).</p><p>Back in 1977, it was clear to even a teenager that <i>Voyager</i> would be something very different from <i>Viking</i>. First of all, it would embark on a long journey. It would sail on for more than a decade at least, and if nothing bad happened along the way, the plutonium-fueled nuclear power pack that generated electricity for the spacecraft could keep the systems working for perhaps <i>fifty years</i>. With that kind of longevity, it was possible for the spacecraft to survive long enough to cross into interstellar space&#x2014;the realm outside of our sun&#x2019;s protective magnetic cocoon. <i>Voyager</i> would then venture out into the strange and unfamiliar interstellar wind. Wild. And second, the mission had the potential to literally discover entirely new and alien worlds! <i>Viking </i>had<i> </i>made important discoveries on Mars, but the landscape and processes had generally been familiar: wind, sand, maybe a little water long ago, grinding down and carving into the rock, eroding landscapes like you might encounter on a car trip through northern Arizona, Utah, and southern Colorado. <i>Voyager</i> would be encountering worlds not of rock, but of ice and gas, places where the sun is only the blip of a flashlight in an otherwise black, starry sky, and where the temperature might be only a few tens of degrees above absolute zero.</p><p>Through my youthful eyes, the biggest appeal of <i>Voyager </i>was indeed this idea of exploring the truly unknown&#x2014;throwing a bottle, of sorts, into the cosmic ocean and seeing where the eddies and currents of nature would take it. In my telescope, on a clear cold night, I could make out the reddish-brown belts and bands of Jupiter, as well as its famous Great Red Spot. It was a good-sized instrument for a young amateur astronomer, a so-called Newtonian telescope (designed by Isaac Newton, and using mirrors instead of lenses) made by a company called Meade Instruments, with a main mirror about eight inches in diameter and a tube about four feet long. With that tube held by a metal mounting post and three wide metal legs, it was a heavy, bulky, cumbersome thing to schlep outside and in from the garage and to set up every time I wanted to use it (especially in the snow), but it was so worth the effort. I could resolve the enchanting, creamy yellow rings of Saturn and learned firsthand why that planet was called &#x201c;the jewel of the solar system&#x201d; by the pioneers of astronomy. It always amazed me, in fact, that when I looked at Saturn I was seeing <i>the real Saturn.</i> Like a lot of kids at the time, I collected coins and stamps and baseball cards, and that was great, but there was always someone with an older, better, or cooler collec...</p></p><h2>A twist of Lennon</h2><p>. 1978 Star pub, light tanning to pages</p><p></p><h2>Color Purple</h2><p>Winner of the American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, this unforgettable portrait of a young black girl, her friends, family, and lovers is rich with passion, pain, inspiration, and an indomitable love of life.</p><p><b>[Banner] Now a Tony Award-Winning Broadway Musical</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Color Purple </i>is the story of two sisters&#x2014;one a missionary to Africa and the other a child wife living in the South&#x2014;who remain loyal to one another across time, distance, and silence.

Skilled at puncturing financial bubbles and other delusions of the Wall Street crowd, Burton Malkiel shows why a broad portfolio of stocks selected at random will match the performance of one carefully chosen by experts. Taking a shrewd look at the high-tech boom and its aftermath, Malkiel shows how to maximize gains and minimize losses in this era of electronic brokers, virtual gurus, and flashy investment vehicles. Learn how to analyze the potential returns, not only for stocks and bonds, but for the full range of investment opportunities, from money market accounts and real estate investment trusts to insurance, home owning, and tangible assets like gold and collectibles. Decode the rating game for mutual funds, and discover the unique advantages of index mutual funds over the wide range of riskier alternatives. Year in and year out the best investing guide money can buy, this enhanced edition includes an update of Professor Malkiel's famous "Life-Cycle Guide to Investing," showing how to match an investment strategy to your stage of life.</p><p>It's unlikely that you'll spot many dog-eared copies of <i>A Random Walk</i> floating amongst the Wall Street set (although bookshelves at home may prove otherwise). After all, a "random walk"--in market terms--suggests that a "blindfolded monkey" would have as much luck selecting a portfolio as a pro. But Burton Malkiel's classic investment book is anything but random. Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.<p> First published in 1973, this seventh printing of a <i>A Random Walk</i> looks forward and does so broadly, examining a new range of investment choices facing the turn-of-the-century investor: money-market accounts, tax-exempt funds, Roth IRAs, and equity REITs, as well as the potential benefits and pitfalls of the emerging global economy. In his updated "life-cycle guide to investing," Malkiel offers age-related investment strategies that consider one's <i>capacity</i> for risk. (A 30-year-old who can depend on wages to offset investment losses has a different risk capacity from a 60-year-old.) In his assessment of rocketing Internet stocks, Malkiel defends his "random" position well, explaining how "the market eventually corrects any irrationality--albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But eventually, true value is recognized by the market, and this is the main lesson investors must heed." Written for the financial layperson but bolstered by 30 years of research, <i>A Random Walk</i> will help individual investors take charge of their financial future.

She still dreams of seeing the ocean and eventually making a new life in France.<br>Shauzia finally decides to leave the camp and try her luck on the streets. She is determined to earn money to leave Pakistan. Peshawar is dangerous and full of desperately poor children like herself, but she has her dog Jasper.She figures she knows how to survive, but an incident with a dishonest man lands her in jail, where she spends the night, terrified and despairing, before she is rescued by well-meaning Americans.<br>They take her and Jasper to their home in a residential part of Peshawar, and for a time she has a taste of a life where children are safe and have food to eat. But just when she thinks the family will ask her to stay with them, disaster ensues, and Shauzia finds herself driven back to the refugee camp, where she discovers the old choices are not so easy any more.</p><p>Deborah Ellis has achieved international acclaim with her courageous and dramatic books that give Western readers a glimpse into the plight of children in developing countries.

In 2006, Deb was named to the Order of Ontario.The final book in Ellis&#39;s BREADWINNER trilogy is the story of Shauzia, a young Afghani refugee in Pakistan who dreams of freedom. Meera Simhan&#39;s narration brings to life the harshness of existence for refugees. She gives 13-year-old Shauzia a believable voice, filled with the self-centeredness of a young person who is trying to exert her independence and cling to her dreams of a better life. Simhan&#39;s narration reflects Shauzia&#39;s growth as she develops into a young heroine who learns the importance of community. An author&#39;s note gives historical context to the story and provides the listener with sources through which to lend aid to Afghani refugees.

Reprint.</p><p>Margaret Mahy (1936-2012) worked as a librarian in her native New Zealand before becoming a full-time writer in 1980. Beloved by generations of readers, she wrote over 150 books for children and young adults, and in 2006, she received the Hans Christian Andersen Award (the &#34;Nobel Prize of children&#39;s books&#34;) for her contribution to children&#39;s literature.Kindergarten-Grade 4-- The seven brothers walk, talk, and look alike, but each has his own special power. When the third brother runs afoul of the emperor and is sentenced to be beheaded, the fourth brother, who has bones of iron, takes his place. The emperor then tries drowning and burning but each time a different brother foils his scheme. Mahy retells this traditional Chinese tale in graceful, witty prose. She uses classic storytelling elements to their best advantage and, without any attempt to imitate Chinese syntax, her choice of words gives a feeling of time and place. Both jacket notes and an editor's foreword give background information about the tale. Beginning with the cover, which shows the smiling brothers looming over a cowering emperor, the Tsengs' rich watercolors complement and enhance the story. With great skill, they interweave elements of ancient Chinese painting with lively pictorial storytelling. The emperor, encased in voluminous ceremonial robes, is an embodiment of corrupt yet insecure power, and the beautiful faces of the seven brothers, although alike, glow with life. Many readers will be familiar with the classic Claire Bishop/Kurt Wiese version of the The Five Chinese Brothers (Coward-McCann, 1938). The style of both text and illustrations is so different from the Mahy/Tseng book that comparisions are inappropriate. An exceptional new telling of the story. --Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Lips Shall Praise Thee</h2><p>Children who learn early in life that god knows them, loves them and cares for them have a greatly increased potential for developing stable, happy personalities, with a joyful love of God.</p><p></p><h2>Saveur: The New Comfort Food - Home Cooking from Around the World</h2><p>From the pages of <em>Saveur</em> magazine, one of the world's premier food publications, comes a celebration of the enormous range of regional American and international dishes that have shaped the classic comfort foods of today.

Her extraordinary illustrative style is seen as a design classic the world over. Originally written in Swedish, the Moomintroll books have been translated into over 40 languages and adapted for television, film, radio and opera. Tove Jansson lived alone on a small island in the gulf of Finland, where most of her books were written.

It was a wonderful valley, full of happy little animals and flowering trees, and there was a clear narrow river that came down from the mountain, looped round Moominhouse, and disappeared in the direction of<br>another valley, where no doubt other little animals wondered where it came from.<br>*It was painted blue. Moomin houses usually are. Translator.<br>One morning&#x2014;it was the morning that Moomintroll&#x2019;s pappa finished building a bridge over the river&#x2014;the little animal Sniff made a discovery. (There were still plenty of things left for them to discover in the valley.) He was wandering in the forest when he suddenly noticed a path he had never seen before winding mysteriously into the green shadows. Sniff was spellbound and stood gazing at it for several minutes.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny about paths and rivers,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;You see them go by, and suddenly you feel upset and want to be somewhere else&#x2014;wherever the path or the river is going, perhaps. I shall have to tell Moomintroll about this, and we can explore it together, because it would be a bit risky for me to go alone.&#x201d; Then he carved a secret sign on a tree trunk with his penknife, so that he could find the place again, and thought proudly: &#x201c;Moomintroll will be surprised.&#x201d; And after that he scooted home as fast as he could so as not to be late for lunch.<br>Moomintroll was just putting up a swing when Sniff got home. He seemed very interested in the mysterious path, and directly after lunch they set off to have a look at it.<br>Halfway up the hill on their way grew a clump of blue-trees covered with big yellow pears, and of course they couldn&#x2019;t get past that without Sniff deciding that he was hungry.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better only take the windfalls,&#x201d; said Moomintroll, &#x201c;because mamma makes jam from these.&#x201d; But they had to shake the tree a little so that there were some windfalls.<br>Sniff was very pleased with their haul. &#x201c;You can carry the provisions,&#x201c; he said, &#x201c;because you haven&#x2019;t got anything else to do, have you? I&#x2019;m too busy to think about things like that when I&#x2019;m the Path Pioneer&#x201c;<br>When they reached the top of the hill they turned and looked down at the valley. Moomin house was just a blue dot, and the river a narrow ribbon of green: the swing they couldn&#x2019;t see at all. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never been such a long way from home before,&#x201c; said Moomintroll, and a little goose- fleshy thrill of excitement came over them at the thought.<br>Sniff started to snuffle about. He looked at the sun, felt the direction of the wind, sniffed the air, and in fact behaved in every way like a great Path Pioneer.<br>&#x201c;It should be somewhere here,&#x201d; he said busily. &#x201c;I made a secret sign with my knife on a plum tree just where it began.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Could it possibly be here?&#x201d; asked Moomintroll, pointing to a curly flourish on a tree trunk on the left.<br>&#x201c;No! Here it is!&#x201d; screamed Sniff, who had found another curly flourish on a tree trunk on the right.<br>At the same time they both caught sight of a third curly flourish on a tree trunk right in front of them, but it was terribly high up, at least three feet above the ground.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; said Sniff, stretching himself. &#x201c;I must be taller than I thought!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, strike me pink!&#x201d; exclaimed Moomintroll, looking around. &#x201c;There are curly flourishes everywhere! And some of them are nearly a hundred feet up. I think you&#x2019;ve found a haunted path, Sniff, and now the spooks are trying to stop us from using it. What do you say to that?&#x201d;<br>Sniff didn&#x2019;t say anything, but he got very pale about the nose. And at that moment a cackle of spooky laughter broke the silence, and down fell a big blue plum, which nearly hit Moomintroll in the eye. Sniff gave a screech of terror and ran for cover, but Moomintroll was just angry, and had decided to have a look for the enemy when, all of a sudden, he saw who it was. For the first time in his life he was face to face with a silk-monkey!<br>She was crouching in the fork of a tree: a small, dark, velvety ball. Her face was round and much lighter than the rest of her (about the color of Sniff&#x2019;s nose when he had washed rather carelessly), and her laugh was ten times bigger than herself.<br>&#x201c;Stop that horrible cackling!&#x201d; shouted Moomintroll when he saw that she was smaller than he. &#x201c;This is our valley. You can go and laugh somewhere else.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wretched wretch!&#x201d; muttered Sniff, pretending he hadn&#x2019;t been frightened. But the silk-monkey just hung by her tail and laughed louder than ever. Then she threw some more plums at them and disappeared into the forest with a parting hoot of evil laughter.<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s running away!&#x201d; screamed Sniff. &#x201c;Come on&#x2014; let&#x2019;s follow her.&#x201d; So off they rushed, scrambling headlong through bushes and brambles under a perfect rain of ripe berries and fircones, while all the little animals underfoot escaped into their holes as quickly as they possibly could.<br>The silk-monkey swung from tree to tree in front of them; she hadn&#x2019;t enjoyed herself so much for weeks.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s ridiculous (puff) to run after a silly little monkey like that,&#x201d; panted Sniff at last. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see (puff) that she matters.&#x201d;<br>Moomintroll agreed to this, and they sat down under a tree and pretended to be thinking about something important. The silk-monkey made herself comfortable in the fork of a tree above them and tried to look important too; she was having nearly as much fun as before.<br>&#x201c;Take no notice of her,&#x201d; whispered Moomintroll. Out loud he said: &#x201c;Good spot this, isn&#x2019;t it, Sniff?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Interesting-looking path, too,&#x201d; Sniff answered.<br>&#x201c;Path,&#x201d; repeated Moomintroll thoughtfully. And then he suddenly noticed where they were. &#x201c;Why, this must be the Mysterious Path,&#x201d; he gasped.<br>It certainly looked most mysterious. Overhead the branches of the plum trees, oaks, and silver poplars met and formed a dark tunnel which led away into the unknown.<br>&#x201c;Now, we must take this seriously,&#x201d; said Sniff, remembering that he was the Path Pioneer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look for by-paths, and you knock three times if you see anything dangerous.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What shall I knock on?&#x201d; asked Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;Whatever you like,&#x201d; said Sniff. &#x201c;Only don&#x2019;t talk. And what have you done with the provisions? I suppose you&#x2019;ve lost them. Oh, dear! Do I have to do everything myself?&#x201d;<br>Moomintroll wrinkled his forehead dejectedly but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>So they wandered farther into the green tunnel, Sniff looking for by-paths, Moomintroll looking for dangerous intruders, and the silk-monkey leaping overhead from branch to branch.<br>The path wound in and out of the trees, getting narrower and narrower, until at last it petered out altogether. Moomintroll looked baffled. &#x201c;Well, that seems to be that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It ought to have led to something very special.&#x201d;<br>They stood still and looked at each other in disappointment. But as they stood a whiff of salt wind blew in their faces and a faint sighing could be heard in the distance.<br>&#x201c;It must be the sea!&#x201d; exclaimed Moomintroll with a whoop of joy, and he started running upwind, his heart thumping with excitement, for if there is anything Moomintrolls really love, it is swimming.<br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; screamed Sniff. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave me behind!&#x201d;<br>But Moomintroll didn&#x2019;t stop till he came to the sea, and there he sat down and solemnly watched the waves rolling in, one after another, each with its crest of white foam.<br>After a while Sniff came out from the fringe of the wood and joined him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;By the way, do you remember when we sailed with the Hattifatteners in that dreadful storm, and I was so seasick?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite another story,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m going to swim.&#x201d; And he ran straight out into the breakers, without stopping to undress (because, of course, Moomintrolls don&#x2019;t wear clothes, except sometimes in bed).<br>The silk-monkey had climbed down from her tree and was sitting on the sandy beach watching them. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know it&#x2019;s wet and cold?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve managed to impress her at last!&#x201d; said Sniff.<br>&#x201c;Yes. I say, Sniff, can you dive with your eyes open?&#x201d; asked Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; said Sniff. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t intend to try&#x2014;you never know what you&#x2019;ll see down there on the bottom. If you do it, don&#x2019;t blame me if something awful happens!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pooh!&#x201d; said Moomintroll, diving into a big wave and swimming down through green bubbles of light. He went deeper and came upon forests of crinkly seaweed swaying gently in the current&#x2014;seaweed that was decorated with beautiful white and pink shells&#x2014;and even farther down the green twilight deepened until he could see only a black hole that seemed to have no bottom.<br>Moomintroll turned round and shot up to the surface, where a big wave carried him right back to the beach. There sat Sniff and the silk-monkey screaming for help at the tops of their voices.<br>&#x201c;We thought you were drowned,&#x201d; said Sniff, &#x201c;or that a shark had eaten you up!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pooh!&#x201d; said Moomintroll again. &amp;ld...</p></p><h2>Well-Schooled in Murder</h2><p>When thirteen-year-old Matthew Whately goes missing from Bredgar Chambers, a prestigious public school in the heart of West Sussex, aristocratic Inspector Thomas Lynley receives a call for help from the lad's housemaster, who also happens to be an old school chum. Thus, the inspector, his partner, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, and forensic scientist Simon Allcourt-St. James find themselves once again outside their jurisdiction and deeply involved in the search for a child&#x2014;and then, tragically, for a child killer. Questioning prefects, teachers, and pupils closest to the dead boy, Lynley and Havers sense that something extraordinarily evil is going on behind Bredgar Chambers's cloistered walls. But as they begin to unlock the secrets of this closed society, the investigation into Matthew's death leads them perilously close to their own emotional wounds&#x2014;and blinds them to the signs of another murder in the making....<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"George is a master...an outstanding practitioner of the modern English mystery."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i><p>"A spectacular new voice in mystery writing."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times</i><br> <br>"A compelling whodunit...a reader's delight."<br><i>--Daily News,</i> New York</p><p>"Like P.D.

She is a member of the&nbsp;Pre-Joycean Fellowship.This delightful new entry in the Fairy Tale series, featuring children's classics refashioned for adult audiences, adapts the eponymous Scottish ballad to a Midwestern university setting. In the early '70s, scholarly Janet Carter enters Blackstock College as an English major. She and roommates Christina and Molly fall in with an attractive, often eccentric group of classics students who circle around Professor Medeous, a spectacular, enigmatic redheaded woman. The girls pair off with young male classicists, Janet beginning an affair with Nicholas Tooley, whose vast familiarity with Shakespeare and often distant approach to intimacy disturb her. When the liaison ends, she takes up with the young man formerly attached to Christina. The ghost of a pregnant student who committed suicide, mysterious late-night horseback forays led by Professor Medeous and the appearance in a list of Shakespeare's actors of the names of three of the Classics Department scholars urge Janet on a dangerous quest to save her lover. Dean ( The Whim of the Dragon ) has written a quintessential college novel, anchoring its fantastic elements in a solid, engaging reality. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Vogue� Knitting The Ultimate Sock Book: History*Technique*Design</h2><p>The editors at <i>Vogue� Knitting</i>, the most trusted name in the craft, have done it again, creating the most comprehensive guide available to sock knitters!

He waited, savoring the moment, and then he unlocked a cage on the panel and pulled down a small red bar.<br>There was no hum, no sound, nothing to indicate that the most expensive scientific instrument on earth had been turned on. Except that, two hundred miles away, the lights of Las Vegas dimmed ever so slightly.<br>As Isabella warmed up, Dolby began to feel the fine vibration of her through the floor. He thought of the machine as a woman, and in his more imaginative moments he had even imagined what she looked like&#x2014;tall and slender, with a muscular back, black as the desert night, beaded with sweat. Isabella. He had shared these feelings with no one&#x2014;no point in attracting ridicule. To the rest of the scientists on the project, Isabella was an &#x201c;it,&#x201d; a dead machine built for a specific purpose. But Dolby had always felt a deep affection for the machines he created&#x2014;from when he was ten years old and constructed his first radio from a kit. Fred. That was the radio&#x2019;s name. And when he thought of Fred, he saw a fat carroty-haired white man. The first computer he had built was Betty&#x2014;who looked in his head like a brisk and efficient secretary. He couldn&#x2019;t explain why his machines took on the personalities they did&#x2014;it just happened.<br>And now this, the world&#x2019;s most powerful particle accelerator . . . Isabella.<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s it look?&#x201d; asked Hazelius, the team leader, coming over and placing an affectionate hand on his shoulder.<br>&#x201c;Purring like a cat,&#x201d; said Dolby.<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Hazelius straightened up and spoke to the team. &#x201c;Gather round, I have an announcement to make.&#x201d;<br>Silence fell as the team members straightened up from their workstations and waited. Hazelius strode across the small room and positioned himself in front of the biggest of the plasma screens. Small, slight, as sleek and restless as a caged mink, he paced in front of the screen for a moment before turning to them with a brilliant smile. It never ceased to amaze Dolby what a charismatic presence the man had.<br>&#x201c;My dear friends,&#x201d; he began, scanning the group with turquoise eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 1492. We&#x2019;re at the bow of the Santa Maria, gazing at the sea horizon, moments before the coastline of the New World comes into view. Today is the day we sail over that unknown horizon and land upon the shores of our very own New World.&#x201d;<br>He reached down into the Chapman bag he always carried and pulled out a bottle of Veuve Clicquot. He held it up like a trophy, his eyes sparkling, and thumped it down on the table. &#x201c;This is for later tonight, when we set foot on the beach. Because tonight, we bring Isabella to one hundred percent full power.&#x201d;<br>Silence greeted the announcement. Finally Kate Mercer, the assistant director of the project, spoke. &#x201c;What happened to the plan to do three runs at ninety-five percent?&#x201d;<br>Hazelius returned her look with a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m impatient. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Mercer brushed back her glossy black hair. &#x201c;What if we hit an unknown resonance or generate a miniature black hole?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your own calculations show a one in quadrillion chance of that particular downside.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My calculations might be wrong.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your calculations are never wrong.&#x201d; Hazelius smiled and turned to Dolby. &#x201c;What do you think? Is she ready?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re damn right she&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br>Hazelius spread his hands. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br>Everyone looked at each other. Should they risk it? Volkonsky, the Russian programmer, suddenly broke the ice. &#x201c;Yes, we go for it!&#x201d; He high-fived a startled Hazelius, and then everyone began slapping each other on the back, shaking hands, and hugging, like a basketball team before a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hours and as many bad coffees later, Dolby stood before the huge flat-panel screen. It was still dark&#x2014;the matter&#x2013;antimatter proton beams had not been brought into contact. It took forever to power up the machine and cool down Isabella&#x2019;s superconducting magnets to carry the very large currents necessary. Then it was a matter of increasing beam luminosity by increments of 5 percent, focusing and collimating the beams, checking the superconducting magnets, running various test programs, before going up to the next 5 percent.<br>&#x201c;Power at ninety percent,&#x201d; Dolby intoned.<br>&#x201c;Christ damn,&#x201d; said Volkonsky somewhere behind him, giving the Sunbeam coffeemaker a blow that made it rattle like the Tin Man. &#x201c;Empty already!&#x201d;<br>Dolby repressed a smile. During the two weeks they&#x2019;d been up on the mesa, Volkonsky had revealed himself as a wiseass, a slouching, mangy specimen of Eurotrash with long greasy hair, ripped T-shirts, and a pubic clump of beard clinging to his chin. He looked more like a drug addict than a brilliant software engineer. But then, a lot of them were like that.<br>Another measured ticking of the clock.<br>&#x201c;Beams aligned and focused,&#x201d; said Rae Chen. &#x201c;Luminosity fourteen TeV.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Isabella work fine,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;My systems are all green,&#x201d; said Cecchini, the particle physicist.<br>&#x201c;Security, Mr. Wardlaw?&#x201d;<br>The senior intelligence officer, Wardlaw, spoke from his security station. &#x201c;Just cactus and coyotes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Hazelius. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time.&#x201d; He paused dramatically. &#x201c;Ken? Bring the beams into collision.&#x201d;<br>Dolby felt a quickening of his heart. He touched the dials with his spiderlike fingers, adjusting them with a pianist&#x2019;s lightness of touch. He followed with a series of commands rapped into the keyboard.<br>&#x201c;Contact.&#x201d;<br>The huge flat-panel screens all around suddenly woke up. A sudden singing noise seemed to float in the air, coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Mercer asked, alarmed.<br>&#x201c;A trillion particles blowing through the detectors,&#x201d; said Dolby. &#x201c;Sets up a high vibration.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, it sounds like the monolith in 2001.&#x201d;<br>Volkonsky hooted like an ape. Everyone ignored him.<br>An image appeared on the central panel, the Visualizer. Dolby stared at it, entranced. It was like an enormous flower&#x2014;flickering jets of color radiating from a single point, twisting and writhing as if trying to tear free of the screen. He stood in awe at the intense beauty of it.<br>&#x201c;Contact successful,&#x201d; said Rae Chen. &#x201c;Beams are focused and collimated. God, it&#x2019;s a perfect alignment!&#x201d;<br>Cheers and some ragged clapping.<br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; said Hazelius, &#x201c;welcome to the shores of the New World.&#x201d; He gestured to the Visualizer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at an energy density not seen in the universe since the Big Bang.&#x201d; He turned to Dolby. &#x201c;Ken, please increase power in increments of tenths to ninety-nine.&#x201d;<br>The ethereal sound increased slightly as Dolby worked on the keyboard. &#x201c;Ninety-six,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Luminosity seventeen point four TeV,&#x201d; said Chen.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-seven . . . Ninety-eight.&#x201d;<br>The team fell into tense silence, the only sound now the humming that filled the underground control room, as if the mountain around them were singing.<br>&#x201c;Beams still focused,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Luminosity twenty-two point five TeV.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine.&#x201d;<br>The sound from Isabella had become still higher, purer.<br>&#x201c;Just a moment,&#x201d; said Volkonsky, hunching over the supercomputer workstation. &#x201c;Isabella is . . . slow.&#x201d;<br>Dolby turned sharply. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with the hardware. It must be another software glitch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Software not problem,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;Maybe we should hold it here,&#x201d; said Mercer. &#x201c;Any evidence of miniature black hole creation?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Not a trace of Hawking radiation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point five,&#x201d; said Dolby.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting a charged jet at twenty-two point seven TeV,&#x201d; said Chen.<br>&#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; asked Hazelius.<br>&#x201c;An unknown resonance. Take a look.&#x201d;<br>Two flickering red lobes had developed on either side of the flower on the central screen, like a clown&#x2019;s ears gone wild.<br>&#x201c;Hard-scattering,&#x201d; said Hazelius. &#x201c;Gluons maybe. Might be evidence of a Kaluza-Klein graviton.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Not at this luminosity.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point six.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gregory, I think we should hold the power steady here,&#x201d; said Mercer. &#x201c;A lot of stuff is happening all at once.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Naturally we&#x2019;re seeing unknown resonances,&#x201d; Hazelius said, his voice no louder than the rest, but somehow distinct from them all. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in unknown territory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point seven,&#x201d; Dolby intoned. He had complete confidence in his machine. He could take her to one hundred percent and beyond, if necessary. It gave him a thrill to know they were now sucking up almost a quarter of the juice from Hoover Dam. That was why they had to do their runs in the middle of the night&#x2014;when power usage was lowest.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point eight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some kind of really big unknown interaction here,&#x201d; said Mercer.<br>&#x201c;What is problem, bitch?&#x201d; Volkonsky shouted at the computer.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, we&#x2019;re poking our finger into a Kaluza-Klein space,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredible.&#x201d;<br>Snow began to appear on the big flat panel with the flower.<br>&#x201c;Isabella is behave strange,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d; Hazelius said, from his position at the center of the Bridge.<br>&#x201c;Glacky.&#x201d;<br>Dolby rolled his eyes. Volkonsky was such a pain. &#x201c;All systems go on my board.&#x201d;<br>Volkonsky typed furiously on the keyboard; then he swore in Russian and whacked the monitor with the flat of his hand.<br>&#x201c;Gregory, don&#x2019;t you think we should power down?&#x201d; asked Mercer.<br>&#x201c;Give it a minute more,&#x201d; said Hazelius.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point nine,&#x201d; said Dolby. In the past five minutes, the room had gone from sleepy to bug-eyed awake, tense as hell. Only Dolby felt relaxed.<br>&#x201c;I agree with Kate,&#x201d; said Volkonsky. &#x201c;I not like the way Isabella behave. We start power-down sequence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take full responsibility,&#x201d; said Hazelius. &#x201c;Everything is still well within specs. The data stream of ten terabits per second is starting to stick in its craw, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Craw? What means &#x2018;craw&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Power at one hundred percent,&#x201d; said Dolby, a note of satisfaction in his laid-back voice.<br>&#x201c;Beam luminosity at twenty-seven point one eight two eight TeV,&#x201d; said Chen.<br>Snow spackled the computer screens. The singing noise filled the room like a voice from the beyond. The flower on the Visualizer writhed and expanded. A black dot, like a hole, appeared at the center.<br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Losing all data at Coordinate Zero.&#x201d;<br>The flower flickered. Dark streaks shot through it.<br>&#x201c;This is nuts,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not kidding, the data&#x2019;s vanishing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not possible,&#x201d; said Volkonsky. &#x201c;Data is not vanish. Particles is vanish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Give me a break. Particles don&#x2019;t vanish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No joke, particles is vanish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Software problem?&#x201d; Hazelius asked.<br>&#x201c;Not software problem,&#x201d; said Volkonsky loudly. &#x201c;Hardware problem.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Screw you,&#x201d; Dolby muttered.<br>&#x201c;Gregory, Isabella might be tearing the &#x2019;brane,&#x201d; said Mercer. &#x201c;I really think we should power down now.&#x201d;<br>The black dot grew, expanded, began swallowing the image on the screen. At its margins, it jittered manically with intense color.<br>&#x201c;These numbers are wild,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting extreme space-time curvature right at CZero. It looks like some kind of singularity. We might be creating a black hole.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; said Alan Edelstein, the team&#x2019;s mathematician, looking up from the workstation he had been quietly hunched over in the corner. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no evidence of Hawking radiation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I swear to God,&#x201d; said Chen loudly, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re ripping a hole in space-time!&#x201d;<br>On the screen that ran the program code in real time, the symbols and numbers were flying by like an express train. On the big screen above their heads, the writhing flower had disappeared, leaving a black void. Then there was movement in the void&#x2014;ghostly, batlike. Dolby stared at it, surprised.<br>&#x201c;Damn it, Gregory, power down!&#x201d; Mercer called.<br>&#x201c;Isabella not accept input!&#x201d; Volkonsky yelled. &#x201c;I lose core routines!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hold steady for a moment until we can figure out what&#x2019;s going on,&#x201d; said Hazelius.<br>&#x201c;Gone! Isabella gone!&#x201d; said the Russian, throwing up his hands and sitting back with a look of disgust on his bony face.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still green across the board,&#x201d; said Dolby. &#x201c;Obviously what you&#x2019;ve got here is a massive software crash.&#x201d; He turned his attention back to the Visualizer. An image was appearing in the void, an image so strange, so beautiful, that at first he couldn&#x2019;t wrap his mind around it. He glanced around, but nobody else was looking: they were all focused on their various consoles.<br>&#x201c;Hey, excuse me&#x2014;anybody know what&#x2019;s going on up there on the screen?&#x201d; Dolby asked.<br>Nobody answered him. Nobody looked up. Everyone was furiously busy. The machine sang strangely.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just the engineer,&#x201d; said Dolby, &#x201c;but any of you theoretical geniuses got an idea of what that is? Alan, is that . . . normal?&#x201d;<br>Alan Edelstein glanced up from his workstation distractedly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just random data,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;What do you mean, random? It&#x2019;s got a shape!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The computer&#x2019;s crashed. It can&#x2019;t be anything but random data.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sure doesn&#x2019;t look random to me.&#x201d; Dolby stared at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s moving. There&#x2019;s something there, I swear&#x2014;it almost looks alive, like it&#x2019;s trying to get out. Gregory, are you seeing this?&#x201d;<br>Hazelius glanced up at the Visualizer and paused, surprise blossoming on his face. He turned. &#x201c;Rae? What&#x2019;s going on with the Visualizer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No idea. I&#x2019;m getting a steady blast of coherent data from the detectors. Doesn&#x2019;t look like Isabella&#x2019;s crashed from here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How would you interpret that thing on the screen?&#x201d;<br>Chen look up and her eyes widened. &#x201c;Jeez. I&#x2019;ve no idea.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s moving,&#x201d; said Dolby. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s, like, emerging.&#x201d;<br>The detectors sang, the room humming with their high-pitched whine.<br>&#x201c;Rae, it&#x2019;s garbage data,&#x201d; Edelstein said. &#x201c;The computer&#x2019;s crashed&#x2014;how can it be real?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not so sure it is garbage,&#x201d; said Hazelius, staring. &#x201c;Michael, what do you think?&#x201d;<br>The particle physicist stared at the image, mesmerized. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. None of the colors and shapes correspond to particle energies, charges, and classes. It isn&#x2019;t even radially centered on CZero&#x2014;it&#x2019;s like a weird, magnetically bound plasma cloud of some kind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you,&#x201d; said Dolby, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s moving, it&#x2019;s coming out. It&#x2019;s like a . . . Jesus, what the hell is it?&#x201d; He closed his eyes hard, trying to chase away the ache of exhaustion. Maybe he was seeing things. He opened them. It was still there&#x2014;and expanding.<br>&#x201c;Shut it down! Shut Isabella down now!&#x201d; Mercer cried.<br>Suddenly the panel filled with snow and went dead black.<br>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Chen cried, her fingers pounding the keyboard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve l...</p><h2>Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose (Classic Seuss)</h2><p>Join one of Dr. Seuss's most giving characters in the classic picture book <i>Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose. </i>Poor Thidwick's generosity proves the adage that no good deed goes unpunished, and soon everyone, from a tiny Bingle Bug to a huge bear, is taking advantage of our antlered hero. With Seuss's rhyming text and endearing illustrations, this beloved story about a kindhearted moose and the bullies that make a home on his horns is an ideal way to introduce children to the invaluable concept of self-respect.</p><p>This classic Seuss title stars a happy-looking quadruped from the shores of Lake Winna-Bango who has the most amazing antlers and the kindest disposition. Alas! Everyone, but everyone, takes advantage of his generosity, and before long he has three-quarters of the animal kingdom nesting in the convenient perches atop his head. ("They asked in a fox, who jumped in from the trees, / They asked in some mice and they asked in some fleas.") You might think someone would take pity, but nobody seems to like an oddball, and all Thidwick gets for his trouble is complaints and contempt. Unable to cross the lake when winter threatens, he looks all set to starve--and then things get even worse. He is saved from certain death just in time, swims the lake, and joins the herd again. One reason this Seuss is so good: it has a moral, but the moral isn't pressed too far and the exuberant linguistic fun isn't subservient to it.

Instead, he focuses on what a set battle is like for the man in the thick of it--his fears, his wounds and their treatment, the mechanics of being taken prisoner, the nature of leadership at the most junior level, the role of compulsion in getting men to stand their ground, the intrusions of cruelty and compassion, the din and blood. <br><br> Set battles, with their unities of time and place, may be a thing of the past, but this anatomy of what they were like for the men who fought them is an unforgettable mirror held up to human nature.</p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettesJOHN KEEGAN is the defense editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London) and Britain's foremost military historian.

By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.</p><p>Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.</p><p>Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, "The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision."</p><p><em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.</p><p>The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, <em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.</p><p>In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.</p><p>Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p></p><p><p>Lou Gerstner, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 until March 2002, when he retired as CEO.

Challenged by customers and employees worldwide and product-service lines that defied integration, Gerstner implemented solutions to turn the company into the integrated business giant it is today. Edward Herrmann's pacing and understated connection with the material in this memoir makes the audio seem compact and relaxed. The writing is also outstanding, lacking excessive pride or self-congratulation, so you don't have to elbow past the author's ego to absorb the many CEO-level insights offered here. An essential volume for anyone interested in technology, large organizations, or IBM's miraculous rebirth under Gerstner's leadership.

When Simmias the Socratic heard this, he interpreted it to mean that all men would try to grasp Plato&#x2019;s meaning but that none would succeed, and each would interpret him according to his own views.</p><p>&#x2014;From an ancient commentator on Plato*</p><p></p><p>I. PLATO AND PHILOSOPHY</p><p>The Greek word philosophia means &#x201c;love of wisdom&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;love&#x201d; because what is at stake is not just intellectual interest but passionate engagement, and &#x201c;wisdom&#x201d; because the goal is not just to acquire expertise but to gain a deeper understanding of the world, of ourselves, and of our place in the world. There are, of course, other claimants to such wisdom&#x2014;religion, mythology, the arts, and science, to name just a few. But philosophy makes a special claim, that it privileges neither revelation nor inspiration nor experimentation but, rather, rigorous logic and rational argument. And among philosophers, Plato has always held pride of place.</p><p>It may not be strictly accurate to say, as Alfred North Whitehead did, that &#x201c;...the European philosophical tradition...consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&#x201d;&#x2020; But Plato is arguably not only the first real philosopher of the West but also one of the greatest, since he set so much of the agenda for future thinkers. His writings range over most of the subfields in which philosophy is now practiced&#x2014;from epistemology to metaphysics, and from ethics to aesthetics; and he ventured also into other disciplines such as political theory, psychology, linguistics, and education. True, it is not always clear how (or even if) the parts of his philosophy are meant to fit together systematically; his arguments are more than occasionally tendentious; and his own views (when they can be discerned) are sometimes unrealistic and even, some have said, dangerous. Nonetheless, Plato manages to identify so many of the important and perennial questions, and the artistic skill with which he explores them&#x2014;the way in which his dialogues enact the thrilling play of ideas&#x2014;sets him up as a standard of literature as well as of thought.</p><p>To appreciate the significance and beauty of Plato&#x2019;s works, one needs to know something about their historical context (section II below), the intellectual milieu out of which they arose (section III), the importance of Socrates and Plato&#x2019;s own philosophical project (section IV), and the literary style and form of the dialogues (section V).*</p><p>II. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p><p>Plato was born in Athens around 429 BCE and died in 347 BCE.&#x2020; His family was aristocratic and politically prominent. Indeed, his relatives, Critias and Charmides (who appear in the dialogues), were leading members of the antidemocratic or oligarchic faction. Perhaps destined for a public career like theirs, Plato received a fine education, in the course of which he fell under the influence of Socrates. But this was a difficult time for Athens. When Plato was just a child, the Peloponnesian War broke out and pitted agains teach other Athens and Sparta (and their respective allies). When the war finally ended after more than two decades (431&#x2013;404 BCE), Athens had been defeated. Although Plato and his contemporaries might not have realized it, the once-great city of Pericles had begun a slow and irreversible decline.</p><p>Things were so different just fifty years before Plato&#x2019;s birth. In 490 BCE the Greek city-states were not fighting among themselves but had banded together against fierce odds to defeat two invasions launched by the powerful Persian empire. When the Persian Wars ended in 479 BCE, Athens, which had taken a leadership role, had itself become an empire. With the prestige, confidence, and riches it had thereby acquired, the Athenian democracy fostered a burst of intellectual and cultural activity with few parallels in history. This is the moment in which the great Greek tragedies were performed, when historiography was invented by Herodotus (who wrote about the Persian Wars), when the Parthenon was built, and when the Greek Enlightenment really took hold, freeing human minds to question old assumptions and to examine the world with fresh eyes.</p><p>We can get a sense of this creativity and excitement from Plato&#x2019;s dialogues, which were written in the fourth century BCE but are mostly set in the second half of the fifth, before Athens&#x2019; defeat. They portray intellectual, cultural, and political leaders discussing such heady topics as the nature of justice, love, courage, beauty, and piety; the ideal form of the state; the best way to educate the young; the place of the arts in society; the objects of knowledge and ways of knowing; and the existence of the soul. The historian of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, reports that the great statesman Pericles characterized Athens at this time as rich, confident, open, and free&#x2014;a city that nurtured creativity and whose citizens tempered self-interest with a concern for the common good. Athens, he said, was &#x201c;an education to Greece&#x201d; and a city with which all should &#x201c;fall in love.&#x201d;*</p><p>It is ironic that Pericles&#x2019; exposition of the ideology of the democracy was delivered as a funeral oration for those who had recently died in the first year of the Peloponnesian War. A year later Pericles himself was dead, a victim of a plague that descended on Athens as a result of wartime conditions. From then on, as Thucydides analyzes the situation, the war led to Athens&#x2019; moral and political deterioration.</p><p>Plato grew up in this time of insecurity and upheaval. Like other conservatives, he disapproved of the radical democracy whose demagoguery and adventurism had led to Athens&#x2019; defeat. But he also disapproved of the ruthless oligarchy, the Thirty Tyrants, who overthrew the democracy after the war, even though several of their leaders were his relatives. His disillusionment was complete when the democracy was restored in 401 BCE, and one of its first acts was to put his teacher Socrates on trial. The death of Socrates in 399 BCE was a watershed event for philosophy. Deciding not to pursue a political career, Plato left Athens to travel and reflect. When he returned over a decade later, he founded a school, the Academy (so named from its location by a grove sacred to the hero Academus). Here, in what was arguably the first university of Europe (it lasted until the Roman emperor Justinian closed the pagan schools in 529 CE), he spent the rest of his days studying, teaching (one of his pupils was Aristotle), and writing philosophical dialogues, all of which&#x2014;remarkably&#x2014;survive.&#x2020;</p><p>III. INTELLECTUAL BACKGROUND</p><p>When Plato began to write he was reacting not only to political disappointments but also to intellectual provocation by prior or &#x201c;pre-Socratic&#x201d; thinkers&#x2014;specifically, the natural philosophers and the sophists.</p><p>The Natural Philosophers</p><p>During the sixth century BCE, the prosperous cities of Greek Asia Minor saw the rise of a group of intellectuals (the physiologoi) who inquired into the nature (physis) of the physical universe (the cosmos)&#x2014;how it came to be, what it is composed of, and how it is organized. These &#x201c;natural philosophers&#x201d; (as they are sometimes called) rejected the traditional stories (mythoi) that the poets had told about the creation of the world and about arbitrary and willful gods who intervened in it. Instead, they used rational arguments (logoi) to demonstrate the underlying substance or reality of the world and then to explain its apparent diversity and changeability as the result of basic principles like chance or necessity.</p><p>For Thales this basic substance was water, for Anaximenes air, and for Anaximander something he called &#x201c;the boundless.&#x201d;* Parmenides pursued the implications of such thinking by asserting that if reality is one substance, change is not possible. Heraclitus, on the other hand, argued that there is much more change than even the senses reveal and that everything is in flux. Attempting to solve this contradiction, Empedocles argued for the existence of four permanent elements (fire, air, water, earth) and two principles of motion (love/attraction and hate/repulsion) that would account for change. Anaxagoras, on the other hand, seems to have affirmed that Mind is the origin of motion and change. Finally, the Pythagoreans took an entirely different approach, arguing that reality is to be found not in material substances at all but rather in the mathematical proportions of their mixtures, i.e., in numbers. It is not surprising that, by the time of Socrates and Plato, a thinker like the atomist Democritus could take a skeptical position and claim that an objective world exists but that we cannot fully know it.</p><p>Obviously there was great disagreement among the natural philosophers. There was also very little basis on which to choose among their conflicting theories; in a sense, incapable of being tested, they were speculations not unlike the myths they were designed to disenthrone. Finally, these theories attempted to explain only the how and not the why of things. Thus they had little connection to our lived experience or to the deeper questions human beings have about the purpose and meaning of the universe and of our place in it.</p><p>The Sophists</p><p>An alternative approach arose in the fifth and early fourth centuries among another group of thinkers, the sophists (from the Greek sophos, &#x201c;wise&#x201d; or &#x201c;skilled,&#x201d; but later acquiring the pejorative sense of &#x201c;[too] clever&#x201d;). Traveling from city to city and teaching for a fee, they focused less on the physical world and more on individuals and on society. Like the natural philosophers, sophists such as Protagoras, Hippias, Gorgias, and Prodicus are known to us largely from fragmentary texts and accounts by other writers, especially Plato, who had an ax to grind. It is, therefore, difficult to reconstruct a consistent body of teachings, if any existed. But it is clear that their main claim was that they could teach aret. Often translated as &#x201c;virtue,&#x201d; the word actually means &#x201c;excellence,&#x201d; and the excellence that the sophists promised to impart was not primarily ethical but, rather, a set of competencies that would promote success in public life, from a knowledge of general culture to the techniques of public speaking and debate.</p><p>Redirecting attention from the physical to the human world, the sophists were often critical of traditional ideas and practices, questioning whether things were as they were because of nature (physis) or simply because of convention (nomos). Thus, the famous statement attributed to the sophist Protagoras, that &#x201c;man is the measure of all things,&#x201d; affirms the central importance of human beings; but it also expresses a strong relativistic perspective: what appears true to one person is in fact true for that person. Such views laid the sophists open to the charge made by Plato and others that they were not really interested in searching for the truth. Their project was teaching people how to succeed in the world, and that necessitated working within existing belief structures rather than challenging them. Thus, the techniques of persuasion and debate the sophists taught were often aimed at scoring points rather than arriving at the truth, and some even bragged that they could teach their pupils how to make the weaker argument the stronger.</p><p>IV. FROM SOCRATES TO PLATO</p><p>So far, we have seen that Athens&#x2019; political experiences at the end of the fifth century resulted in defeat and disillusionment. Similarly, intellectual developments had also reached an impasse. The theories of the natural philosophers were abstract and of little relevance; and the sophists, who focused on practical matters affecting human beings, failed to advance knowledge and sometimes even distorted the truth.</p><p>It is at this point that Socrates appears on the scene and suggests a way out of these quandaries.* Born in Athens in 469 BCE, he did not participate actively in politics, though he was once chosen by lot to serve on the Council and he fought in several battles of the Peloponnesian War. We don&#x2019;t know how he supported himself, but he seems to have spent most of his time conversing with people whose opinions he exposed as unfounded. He attracted a following, especially among the city&#x2019;s youth, who delighted to see pretension punctured. But in doing this, Socrates also irritated many other people, a fact to which Plato refers when he compares Socrates to a gadfly (Apology 30D&#x2013;31A) or a stingray (Meno 79E&#x2013;80B).</p><p>The earliest representation of Socrates is in Aristophanes&#x2019; comedy The Clouds. He is depicted there as the master of a school, the &#x201c;Think Shop&#x201d; (Phrontisterion), where he hangs from a basket looking upward at the skies, and where he teaches young men to be disputatious for a fee. This portrayal caricatures Socrates as both a natural philosopher and a sophist. Interestingly, the charges that were brought against Socrates almost a quarter of a century later&#x2014;that he was impious and corrupted the young&#x2014;have much in common with this earlier, albeit parodic, portrayal. The Apology, which is Plato&#x2019;s version of the speeches Socrates gave in his own defense, even refers to Aristophanes&#x2019; play. But here in the Apology (19A&#x2013;19D), Socrates denies that he was ever a natural philosopher; and while he elsewhere (Phaedo 96A&#x2013;99D) admits to a youthful infatuation with the subject, he says that he abandoned it because its exponents explained the world as the product of chance or necessity rather than as the work of a purposeful and intelligent designer. Similarly, while Socrates resembled the sophists in that youths gathered around him to hear his conversations, they did so voluntarily and never paid a fee (Apology 19B&#x2013;20C). More important, the lessons they learned from him were very different from those the sophists taught&#x2014;not how to speak but how to think.</p><p>How, then, did Socrates get in trouble? In the Apology Plato has the philosopher tell how his old friend Chaerophon had once asked the Delphic oracle if anyone was wiser than Socrates. When the answer came back that no such person existed, Socrates was perplexed and set out to refute the oracle by interrogating politicians, poets, and craftsmen, all of whom claimed to be wise. That examination, however, only exposed their ignorance and earned Socrates their displeasure.* He was forced to conclude that the oracle was right: he was wise in at least this one respect, namely, that he did not think he knew what he did not really know.</p><p>Many of Plato&#x2019;s dialogues depict Socrates conducting jus...</p></p><h2>From Bauhaus to Our House</h2><p>Takes a critical look at the past fifty years of American architecture and assesses the influence of foreign architects and movements</p><p>4 1-hour cassettes<b>TOM WOLFE</b> is the author of a dozen books, among them such contemporary classics as The <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, and<i> I Am Charlotte Simmons</i>.

It was the summer after the war, and the Ayreses still had most of their money then, were still big people in the district. The event was an Empire Day f�te: I stood with a line of other village children making a Boy Scout salute while Mrs Ayres and the Colonel went past us, handing out commemorative medals; afterwards we sat to tea with our parents at long tables on what I suppose was the south lawn. Mrs Ayres would have been twenty-four or -five, her husband a few years older; their little girl, Susan, would have been about six. They must have made a very handsome family, but my memory of them is vague. I recall most vividly the house itself, which struck me as an absolute mansion. I remember its lovely ageing details: the worn red brick, the cockled window glass, the weathered sandstone edgings. They made it look blurred and slightly uncertain&#x2014;like an ice, I thought, just beginning to melt in the sun.<br>There were no trips inside, of course. The doors and French windows stood open, but each had a rope or a ribbon tied across it; the lavatories set aside for our use were the grooms&#x2019; and the gardeners&#x2019;, in the stable block. My mother, however, still had friends among the servants, and when the tea was finished and people were given the run of the grounds, she took me quietly into the house by a side door, and we spent a little time with the cook and the kitchen girls. The visit impressed me terribly. The kitchen was a basement one, reached by a cool vaulted corridor with something of the feel of a castle dungeon. An extraordinary number of people seemed to be coming and going along it with hampers and trays. The girls had such a mountain of crockery to wash, my mother rolled up her sleeves to help them; and to my very great delight, as a reward for her labour I was allowed to take my pick of the jellies and &#x2018;shapes&#x2019; that had come back uneaten from the f�te. I was put to sit at a deal-topped table, and given a spoon from the family&#x2019;s own drawer&#x2014;a heavy thing of dulled silver, its bowl almost bigger than my mouth.<br>But then came an even greater treat. High up on the wall of the vaulted passage was a junction-box of wires and bells, and when one of these bells was set ringing, calling the parlourmaid upstairs, she took me with her, so that I might peep past the green baize curtain that separated the front of the house from the back. I could stand and wait for her there, she said, if I was very good and quiet. I must only be sure to keep behind the curtain, for if the Colonel or the missus were to see me, there&#x2019;d be a row.<br>I was an obedient child, as a rule. But the curtain opened onto the corner junction of two marble-floored passages, each one filled with marvellous things; and once she had disappeared softly in one direction, I took a few daring steps in the other. The thrill of it was astonishing. I don&#x2019;t mean the simple thrill of trespass, I mean the thrill of the house itself, which came to me from every surface&#x2014;from the polish on the floor, the patina on wooden chairs and cabinets, the bevel of a looking-glass, the scroll of a frame. I was drawn to one of the dustless white walls, which had a decorative plaster border, a representation of acorns and leaves. I had never seen anything like it, outside of a church, and after a second of looking it over I did what strikes me now as a dreadful thing: I worked my fingers around one of the acorns and tried to prise it from its setting; and when that failed to release it, I got out my penknife and dug away with that. I didn&#x2019;t do it in a spirit of vandalism. I wasn&#x2019;t a spiteful or destructive boy. It was simply that, in admiring the house, I wanted to possess a piece of it&#x2014;or rather, as if the admiration itself, which I suspected a more ordinary child would not have felt, entitled me to it. I was like a man, I suppose, wanting a lock of hair from the head of a girl he had suddenly and blindingly become enamoured of.<br>I&#x2019;m afraid the acorn gave at last, though less cleanly than I&#x2019;d been expecting, with a tug of fibre and a fall of white powder and grit; I remember that as disappointing. Possibly I&#x2019;d imagined it to be made of marble.<br>But nobody came, nobody caught me. It was, as they say, the work of a moment. I put the acorn in my pocket, and slipped back behind the curtain. The parlourmaid returned a minute later and took me back downstairs; my mother and I said goodbye to the kitchen staff, and rejoined my father in the garden. I felt the hard plaster lump in my pocket, now, with a sort of sick excitement. I&#x2019;d begun to be anxious that Colonel Ayres, a frightening man, would discover the damage and stop the f�te. But the afternoon ran on without incident until the bluish drawing-in of dusk. My parents and I joined other Lidcote people for the long walk home, the bats flitting and wheeling with us along the lanes as if whirled on invisible strings.<br>My mother found the acorn, of course, eventually. I had been drawing it in and out of my pocket, and it had left a chalky trail on the grey flannel of my shorts. When she understood what the queer little thing in her hand was, she almost wept. She didn&#x2019;t smack me, or tell my father; she never had the heart for arguments. Instead she looked at me, with her tearful eyes, as if baffled and ashamed.<br>&#x2018;You ought to know better, a clever lad like you,&#x2019; I expect she said.<br>People were always saying things like that to me when I was young. My parents, my uncles, my schoolmasters&#x2014;all the various adults who interested themselves in my career. The words used to drive me into secret rages, because on the one hand I wanted desperately to live up to my own reputation for cleverness, and on the other it seemed very unfair, that that cleverness, which I had never asked for, could be turned into something with which to cut me down.<br>The acorn was put on the fire. I found the blackened nub of it among the clinker, next day. That must have been the last grand year for Hundreds Hall, anyway. The following Empire Day f�te was given by another family, in one of the neighbouring big houses; Hundreds had started its steady decline. Soon afterwards the Ayreses&#x2019; daughter died, and Mrs Ayres and the Colonel began to live less publicly. I dimly remember the births of their next two children, Caroline and Roderick&#x2014;but by then I was at Leamington College, and busy with bitter little battles of my own. My mother died when I was fifteen. She had had miscarriage after miscarriage, it turned out, all through my childhood, and the last one killed her. My father lived just long enough to see me graduate from medical school and return to Lidcote a qualified man. Colonel Ayres died a few years later&#x2014;an aneurism, I think.<br>With his death, Hundreds Hall withdrew even further from the world. The gates of the park were kept almost permanently closed. The solid brown stone boundary wall, though not especially high, was high enough to seem forbidding. And for all that the house was such a grand one, there was no spot, on any of the lanes in that part of Warwickshire, from which it could be glimpsed. I sometimes thought of it, tucked away in there, as I passed the wall on my rounds&#x2014;picturing it always as it had seemed to me that day in 1919, with its handsome brick faces, and its cool marble passages, each one filled with marvellous things.<br>So when I did see the house again&#x2014;almost thirty years on from that first visit, and shortly after the end of another war&#x2014;the changes in it appalled me. It was the purest chance that took me out there, for the Ayreses were registered with my partner, David Graham; but he was busy with an emergency case that day, so when the family sent out for a doctor the request was passed on to me. My heart began to sink almost the moment I let myself into the park. I remembered a long approach to the house through neat rhododendron and laurel, but the park was now so overgrown and untended, my small car had to fight its way down the drive. When I broke free of the bushes at last and found myself on a sweep of lumpy gravel with the Hall directly ahead of me, I put on the brake, and gaped in dismay. The house was smaller than in memory, of course&#x2014;not quite the mansion I&#x2019;d been recalling&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d been expecting that. What horrified me were the signs of decay. Sections of the lovely weathered edgings seemed to have fallen completely away, so that the house&#x2019;s uncertain Georgian outline was even more tentative than before. Ivy had spread, then patchily died, and hung like tangled rat&#x2019;s-tail hair. The steps leading up to the broad front door were cracked, with weeds growing lushly up through the seams.<br>I parked my car, climbed out, and almost feared to slam the door. The place, for so large and solid a structure, felt precarious. No one appeared to have heard me arrive, so after a little hesitation I went crunching over the gravel and gingerly climbed the cracked stone steps. It was a hot, still summer&#x2019;s day&#x2014;so windless that when I tugged on the tarnished old brass and ivory bell-pull I caught the ring of it, pure and clear, but distant, as if in the belly of the house. The ring was immediately followed by the faint, gruff barking of a dog.<br>The barks were very soon cut off, and for another long minute there was silence. Then, from somewhere to my right, I heard the scrape of an irregular footstep, and a moment later the son of the family, Roderick, appeared around the corner of the house. He squinted over at me with some suspicion, until noticing the bag in my hand. Drawing a collapsed-looking cigarette from his mouth he called, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re the doctor, are you? We were expecting Dr Graham.&#x2019;<br>His tone was friendly enough, but had a touch of languor to it; as if he were bored by the sight of me already. I left the steps and went over to him, introducing myself as Graham&#x2019;s partner, explaining about Graham&#x2019;s emergency case. He answered blandly, &#x2018;Well, it&#x2019;s good of you to come out. On a Sunday, too; and such a filthy hot one. Come this way, would you? It&#x2019;s quicker than going right through the house. I&#x2019;m Roderick Ayres, by the way.&#x2019;<br>We had in fact met before, on more than one occasion. But he&#x2019;d clearly forgotten that, and as we moved off he gave me his hand for a perfunctory shake. His fingers felt queer against mine, rough as crocodile in some spots, oddly smooth in others: his hands had been burnt, I knew, in a wartime accident, along with a good part of his face. The scars aside, he was handsome: taller than me, but, at twenty-four, still boyish and slender. He was dressed boyishly too, in an open-necked shirt, summer trousers, and stained canvas shoes. He walked unhurriedly, and with a noticeable limp.<br>He said as we went, &#x2018;You know why we called you, I suppose?&#x2019;<br>I said, &#x2018;I was told, for one of your maids.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;One of our maids! I like that. There&#x2019;s only the one: our girl, Betty. Some stomach problem, it seems to be.&#x2019; He looked dubious. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. My mother, my sister, and I tend to manage without doctors as a rule. We muddle through with colds and headaches. But I gather that neglecting the servants is a capital offence these days; they&#x2019;re to get better treatment than us, apparently. So we thought we ought to send for someone. Watch your step just here, look.&#x2019;<br>He had taken me along a gravelled terrace that ran the length of the north side of the Hall; he indicated a spot where the terrace had subsided, making for treacherous dips and cracks. I picked my way around them, interested to have been given a chance to see this side of the house&#x2014;but aghast, again, at how badly the place had been allowed to decline. The garden was a chaos of nettle and bindweed. There was a faint but definite whiff of blocked drains. The windows we passed were streaked and dusty; all were closed, and most were shuttered, except for a pair of glass doors that stood open at the top of a set of flying stone steps wound about with convolvulus. They gave me a view of a large untidy room, a desk with a mess of papers on it, an edge of brocade curtain . . . That was all I had time to see. We had reached a narrow service doorway, and Roderick was standing aside to let me pass.<br>&#x2018;Go on, would you?&#x2019; he said, gesturing with one of his scarred hands. &#x2018;My sister&#x2019;s downstairs. She&#x2019;ll show you to Betty, and fill you in.&#x2019;<br>Only later, recalling his injured leg, would I guess that he must not have wanted me to see him struggling with stairs. As it was, I thought his manner rather casual, and I went past him, saying nothing. At once, I heard him crunching quietly away in his rubber-soled shoes.<br>But I went quietly, myself. This narrow doorway, I had realised, was the one through which my mother had more or less smuggled me, all those years before. I remembered the bare stone stairway it led to, and, following the steps down, I found myself in the dim vaulted passage that had so impressed me then. But here was another disappointment. I had been picturing this passage as something like a crypt or a dungeon; in fact its walls were the glossy cream-and-green of police- and fire-stations, there was a strip of coconut-matting on the flagstone floor, and a mop sat sourly in a bucket. Nobody emerged to greet me, but to my right a half-open door offered a glimpse of the kitchen, so I went softly over and looked inside. Yet another damp squib: I found a large lifeless room with Victorian counters and mortuary surfaces, all brutally scoured and scrubbed. Only the old deal table&#x2014;the very table, by the look of it, where I had eaten my jellies and &#x2018;shapes&#x2019;&#x2014;recalled the excitement of that first visit. It was also the only thing in the room to bear any sign of activity, for there was a small pile of muddy vegetables put out on it, together with a bowl of water and a knife&#x2014;the water discoloured, and the knife wet, as if someone had recently started the task and been called away.<br>I stepped back; and my shoe must have creaked, or scuffed against the coconut-matting. There came again the gruff excited barking of a dog&#x2014;alarmingly close, this time&#x2014;and a second later an elderly black Labrador burst from somewhere into the passage and began hurtling towards me. I stood still with my bag raised while it barked and pranced around me, and soon a young woman appeared behind it, saying mildly, &#x2018;All right, you idiotic creature, that&#x2019;s enough! Gyp! Enough!&#x2014;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x2019; She drew nearer, and I recognised Roderick&#x2019;s sister, Caroline. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t bear a leaping dog, and he knows it. Gyp!&#x2019; She reached forward to give him a swipe upon his haunches with the back of her hand; and at that he subsided.<br>&#x2018;Little imbecile,&#x2019; she said, tugging his ears with a look of indulgence. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s touching really. He thinks every stranger&#x2019;s come to cut our throats and make off with the family silver. We haven&#x2019;t the heart to tell him the silver&#x2019;s all been popped. I thought we were getting Dr Graham. You&#x2019;re Dr Faraday. We&#x2019;ve never been properly introduced, have we?&#x2019;<br>She smiled as she spoke, and offered me her hand. Her grip was firmer than her brother&#x2019;s had been, and more sincere.<br>I&#x2019;d only ever seen her at a distance before, at county events, or on the streets of Warwick and Leamington. She was older than Roderick, twenty-six or twenty-seven, and I&#x2019;d regularly heard her referred to locally as &#x2018;rather hearty&#x2019;, a &#x2018;natural spinster&#x2019;, a &#x2018;clever girl&#x2019;&#x2014;in other words she was noticeably plain, over-tall for a woman, with thickish legs and ankles. ...</p></p><h2>Strega Nona</h2><p>The youngest of readers can now enjoy the story of Strega Nona, the beloved Italian &#34;Grandma Witch,&#34; and her magic pasta-making pot with a slightly abridged, board book version of the original fairy tale.</p><p><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola is one of the most popular children&#x2019;s book authors and illustrators of our time and the winner of the 2011 Children&#x2019;s Literature Legacy Award&nbsp;(formerly known as the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award) for &#x201c;significant and lasting contribution to children&#x2019;s literature,&#x201d; among other lifetime achievement awards.&nbsp;A Newbery Honor winner, he has written and illustrated a number of books, including Caldecott Honor book&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona&nbsp;</i>and its companions, as well as&nbsp;<i>Oliver Button Is a Sissy</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Legend of Old Befana</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Clown of God</i>;&nbsp;<i>Michael Bird-Boy</i>;&nbsp;<i>Andy, That&#x2019;s My Name</i>; and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>Quiet</i>.

More than two million people faced economic collapse and starvation. The Americans, English, and French began a massive airlift to bring sustenance to the city and to thwart the Russian siege. </p><p>Gail Halvorsen was one of hundreds of U.S. pilots involved in the airlift. While in Berlin, he met a group of children standing by the airport watching the incoming planes. Though they hadn't asked for candy, he was impressed to share with them the two sticks of gum he had in his possession. Seeing how thrilled they were by this gesture, he promised to drop more candy to them the next time he flew to the area. </p><p>True to his word, as he flew in the next day, he wiggled the wings of his plane to identify himself, then dropped several small bundles of candy using parachutes crafted from handkerchiefs to slow their fall. Local newspapers picked up the story. Suddenly, letters addressed to "Uncle Wiggly Wings" began to arrive as the children requested candy drops in other areas of the city. </p><p>Enthusiasm spread to America, and candy contributions came from all across the country. Within weeks candy manufacturers began donating candy by the boxcar. </p><p>In May 1949, the highway blockade ended, and the airlift ended in September. But the story of Uncle Wiggly Wings and the candy-filled parachutes lives on-a symbol of human charity.</p></p><p>Gail Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and grew up on small farms in Utah and Idaho. He earned a private pilot license under the non-college Civilian Pilot Training program in September of 1941. Almost concurrently Gail joined the Civil Air Patrol as a pilot. He joined the United States Army Air Corps in June 1942. Fighter pilot training was with the Royal Air Force after which he was returned to the Army Air Corps and was assigned flight duty in foreign transport operations in the South Atlantic Theater. After WWII he flew in the Berlin Airlift where he became known as "Uncle Wiggly Wings", the "Chocolate Flyer" and the "Berlin Candy Bomber." The blockade of Berlin began in June 1948 and ended 12 May 1949. Flights continued until 30 September 1949 to build up reserves. <p>Col. Halvorsen belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has been a Stake President, Bishop, High Councilman, and served in other callings. </p><p>Gail married Alta Jolley of Zion National Park on 16 April 1949. They have five children, 24 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Three of their grandchildren have attended a school named for him in Frankfurt, Germany. </p><p>Approaching 50 years of marriage, Alta died in January 1999. Gail is now married to his high school steady from 62 years ago, Lorraine Pace, who has three children, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. They presently live on their farm in Spanish Fork, Utah. Winters are at Lorraine's place in Arizona.</p>A great part of history that I learned as an adult. Great story but the beginning got a little slow because he wrote many technical and specific things about planes and his flights. If you enjoy airplanes, you'll like that part. But the story of how Gail Halvorsen started the candy bombings, being confronted about it, and all the people who supported and helped it become a success is very good. It is a wonderful story that gave people and children who could have had a hopeless situation, hope and faith in mankind. Wonderful!!! --Amazon<br><br>The Berlin Candy Bomber is a wonderful book. I recommend it for reading. It is extra special to us as my husband took part in the Airlift and it has brought back so many memories. Also, Gail Halvorsen is a personal friend of ours. I strongly recommend it for reading. --Amazon<br><br>This book is very well written, especially considering it was written by a pilot, not an "author." The story told in this book is one of the best you'll find, as it was written by THE Candy Bomber, himself. It's not too long, it's an easy read. Very engaging - I highly recommend it if you're even remotely interested in the Berlin Airlift. --Amazon</p><h2>The mountains of Tibet</h2><p>After dying, a Tibetan woodcutter is given the choice of going to heaven or to live another life anywhere in the universe.</p><p><p>Mordicai Gerstein is the author and illustrator of many beloved books for children. He won the 2004 Caldecott Medal for <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> and is also a painter, sculptor, and prizewinning designer and director of animated films. Mordicai Gerstein lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Susan Yard Harris, who is also an illustrator, and their daughter, Risa. </p>Grade 2 Up This story of the death and reincarnation of a Tibetan woodcutter is a beautifully gentle look at one human being dealing with life's choices and possibilities. As a boy, he thought about other worlds that he would someday visit; as a man, he thought of other countries and people, yet ``he was always busy with his work and his wife and children.'' After his death, he is given the option of being part of ``the endless universe some call heaven'' or living another life, and he chooses another life. The choices which follow take him through all the galaxies, stars, planets, creatures, peoples, countries, and parents before arriving at the final twist in this journey back to where he had beenalmost. Thus, the story comes full circle. The quiet, rhythmic text is in perfect unity with the softly colored but radiant watercolor and gouache illustrations, leaving readers with a sense of wholeness and resolution. The golden borders neatly tuck the story in and add to its feeling of satisfaction and quiet joy. The real world scenes are in neatly boxed frames while the worlds of possibilities are displayed in mandala-like circular drawings. The main character, pictured in his small personal mandala, shows a range of emotions and dance-like movement. The kites held by the children in three scenes connect the multiple worlds of the story, providing both a grounding in the world we know and a means to soar beyond it. Children will appreciate the well-told tale and the joyous satisfaction of being one's own self in a large and magical world. Kay E.

Heaven had certainly smiled on him today! What a stroke of luck that he had spotted the advertisement for a government surplus auction. This van was the answer to his prayers&#x2014;high mileage, of course, and painted a depressing institutional gray, but it seated fifteen and was perfect for his needs.<br>He had long been aware that his congregation was dwindling. There was little interest in religion these days, and no fear of the hellfire that he preached so eloquently. All over Wales chapels were being abandoned and turned into beauty parlors, garages, or even worse, New Age healing centers. Tomos Parry Davies shuddered.<br>Chapel Ebenezer, only a couple of miles down the pass from Llanfair, had been abandoned last year. Tomos feared for the souls of its former flock. If a way could be found to bring them up to Llanfair . . . but many older parishioners didn&#x2019;t drive and there were no buses on Sunday. That&#x2019;s when the idea of a van came to him. To put it in non-Christian terms&#x2014;if Mohammed couldn&#x2019;t come to the mountain, then the mountain would come to Mohammed. He had said nothing to anyone except his wife, and Roberts-the-Pump at the petrol station, who always had an ear to the ground when it came to secondhand cars for sale&#x2014;and he had watched, waited, and prayed. And now his prayers were answered!<br>He closed his eyes and pictured all those new worshipers pouring out of his van and into Chapel Bethel, while his rival, Rev. Powell-Jones of Chapel Beulah across the street, could only stare in disbelief. A satisfied smile spread across his plump, middle-aged face. And so cheap, too. A stroke of luck indeed&#x2014;or rather the Lord&#x2019;s doing. The Lord knew which chapel He wanted to prosper!<br>And this was just the beginning, Rev. Parry Davies said to himself. A bigger congregation meant more money coming in. Then he could replace the oil stove in the corner with a real central heating system, and maybe update the sound system to reach out to the young people. He&#x2019;d have slide shows and video presentations to enhance his sermons. He was going to bring religion back to Llanfair in a big way.<br>He drove through Llanberis, carefully negotiating the last vacationers of the season as they crossed the street to catch the mountain railway to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, which the English insisted on calling Mount Snowdon.<br>Right after Llanberis the road began to climb. He put his foot down and heard a satisfying roar of power from the engine. He chose not to notice the black smoke that hung behind him in the clear mountain air.<br>The village of Nant Peris passed by in a blur. He knew he should have slowed to thirty but he was so excited by the power of his new vehicle that he couldn&#x2019;t slow down. Besides, there was no policeman closer than Constable Evans up in Llanfair. Nobody here to give him a ticket.<br>He came to the last straggling buildings before the pass narrowed and climbed again to reach Llanfair. He turned to look at the abandoned chapel whose congregation he hoped to round up every Sunday. It had been a sad sight, with windows boarded up and door nailed shut. He had almost passed it when he realized that something was going on there. He braked and rammed the heavy gear into reverse with much grinding, followed by an ominous clank. A builder&#x2019;s lorry was parked outside and two men were carrying in a slab of marble.<br>Tomos&#x2019;s face grew hot with anger. What kind of dirty trick was the Lord playing on him? To reopen the chapel when he&#x2019;d just spent his savings on the new van! Was his beautiful plan now doomed to failure?<br>Then he saw the sign over the arched doorway to one side:<br>CHEZ YVETTE. RESTAURANT FRAN�AIS.<br>HIGH QUALITY FRENCH CUISINE.<br>Over it a banner proclaimed, Grand Opening Tomorrow! Tomos felt his blood pressure rising to boiling point. The Lord&#x2019;s house&#x2014;or what had been the Lord&#x2019;s house until recently&#x2014;being turned into a restaurant! And not only a restaurant, but a French restaurant. Chez Yvette. Even the name sounded positively sinful.<br>Tomos Parry Davies put his foot down and roared on up the pass to spread the dreadful news.<br></p><h2>Hippo in the Garden: A Non-Religious Approach to Having a Conversation With God</h2><p>For Ingest Only - Data needs to be cleaned up for all products being loaded</p><p></p><h2>Lustre (Ceramics Handbooks)</h2><p><p>A lustre is a thin layer of metal which is deposited onto the surface<br>of the pot during firing producing a lustrous surface. Lustres are very sought after, fabulous surfaces which can lure you in and keep you spellbound. Lustres can<br>be coloured as golds, coppers, reds and blues, or have a colourless sheen like<br>mother of pearl. Lustre is a very tricky technique offering spectacular results, but it can be<br>quite difficult to achieve successfully, and this handbook aims to<br>explain and simplify the process, with thorough coverage of all the<br>options. The book covers recipes for making your own lustres and<br>techniques for applying and firing (all critical factors), as well as showing you the results of the author's extensive testing to help point you in the right direction. Today one of the<br>most commonly used lustres is a resin lustre (known as the 'commercial'<br>lustre) which also contains some appalling thinners which are known<br>carcinogens. There is therefore an advantage to making your own<br>using more natural materials. This handbook covers every lustre that<br>can be made, with recipes and kiln instructions.</p></p><p><p>Greg Daly has previously written Glazes and Glazing for us, is well<br>established in the ceramic field and has run workshops on creating<br>lustres. He exhibits in group shows around the world, has work in 70<br>different national and international museums and has won many awards<br>for his work.</p><p>&#x201c;The enthusiasm for his personal alchemy and the excitement that exploration generates is evident throughout Daly's book. His extremely thorough approach to record keeping, with constant attention to every detail, is an important example for anyone to follow, if they hope to achieve repeatable effects in what is an uncertain medium.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ceramic Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;A useful specialist handbook for the potter who is particularly fascinated with lustre and wants to create their own lustre effects.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>London Potters News</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lavishly illustrated in glorious colour, a feast for the eyes and a temptation to have a go, or enter on a serious programme ...

At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools&#x2014;machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras&#x2014;and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.</p><p>Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today&#x2019;s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.</p><p>As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?</p></p><p><p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists. In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen.

For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled "Finished with the War: A Soldier&#x2019;s Declaration", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind coming to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war&#x2014;as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime&#x2014;is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

And yet there are places where Time seems to linger lovingly long after youth has departed, and to which he seems loath to bring the evil day. Who has not known some even-tempered old man or woman who seemed to have drunk of the fountain of youth? Who has not seen somewhere an old town that, having long since ceased to grow, yet held its own without perceptible decline?<br><br>Some such trite reflection&#x2014;as apposite to the subject as most random reflections are&#x2014;passed through the mind of a young man who came out of the front door of the Patesville Hotel about nine o&#x2019;clock one fine morning in spring, a few years after the Civil War, and started down Front Street toward the market-house.1 Arriving at the town late the previous evening, he had been driven up from the steamboat in a carriage, from which he had been able to distinguish only the shadowy outlines of the houses along the street; so that this morning walk was his first opportunity to see the town by daylight. He was dressed in a suit of linen duck&#x2014;the day was warm&#x2014;a panama straw hat, and patent leather shoes. In appearance he was tall, dark, with straight, black, lustrous hair, and very clean-cut, high-bred features. When he paused by the clerk&#x2019;s desk on his way out, to light his cigar, the day clerk, who had just come on duty, glanced at the register and read the last entry:<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;John Warwick, Clarence, South Carolina.<br><br>&#x201c;One of the South Ca&#x2019;lina bigbugs, I reckon&#x2014;probably in cotton, or turpentine.&#x201d;2 The gentleman from South Carolina, walking down the street, glanced about him with an eager look, in which curiosity and affection were mingled with a touch of bitterness. He saw little that was not familiar, or that he had not seen in his dreams a hundred times during the past ten years. There had been some changes, it is true, some melancholy changes, but scarcely anything by way of addition or improvement to counterbalance them. Here and there blackened and dismantled walls marked the place where handsome buildings once had stood, for Sherman&#x2019;s march3 to the sea had left its mark upon the town. The stores were mostly of brick, two stories high, joining one another after the manner of cities. Some of the names on the signs were familiar; others, including a number of Jewish names,4 were quite unknown to him.<br><br>A two minutes&#x2019; walk brought Warwick&#x2014;the name he had registered under, and as we shall call him&#x2014;to the market-house, the central feature of Patesville, from both the commercial and the picturesque points of view. Standing foursquare in the heart of the town, at the intersection of the two main streets, a &#x201c;jog&#x201d; at each street corner left around the market-house a little public square, which at this hour was well occupied by carts and wagons from the country and empty drays awaiting hire. Warwick was unable to perceive much change in the market-house. Perhaps the surface of the red brick, long unpainted, had scaled off a little more here and there. There might have been a slight accretion of the moss and lichen on the shingled roof. But the tall tower, with its four-faced clock, rose as majestically and uncompromisingly as though the land had never been subjugated. Was it so irreconcilable, Warwick wondered, as still to peal out the curfew bell, which at nine o&#x2019;clock at night had clamorously warned all negroes, slave or free, that it was unlawful for them to be abroad after that hour, under penalty of imprisonment or whipping?5 Was the old constable, whose chief business it had been to ring the bell, still alive and exercising the functions of his office, and had age lessened or increased the number of times that obliging citizens performed this duty for him during his temporary absences in the company of convivial spirits? A few moments later, Warwick saw a colored policeman in the old constable&#x2019;s place&#x2014;a stronger reminder than even the burned buildings that war had left its mark upon the old town, with which Time had dealt so tenderly.<br><br>The lower story of the market-house was open on all four of its sides to the public square. Warwick passed through one of the wide brick arches and traversed the building with a leisurely step. He looked in vain into the stalls for the butcher who had sold fresh meat twice a week, on market days, and he felt a genuine thrill of pleasure when he recognized the red bandana turban of old Aunt Lyddy, the ancient negro woman who had sold him gingerbread and fried fish, and told him weird tales of witchcraft and conjuration, in the old days when, as an idle boy, he had loafed about the market-house. He did not speak to her, however, or give her any sign of recognition. He threw a glance toward a certain corner where steps led to the town hall above. On this stairway he had once seen a manacled free negro shot while being taken upstairs for examination under a criminal charge. Warwick recalled vividly how the shot had rung out. He could see again the livid look of terror on the victim&#x2019;s face, the gathering crowd, the resulting confusion. The murderer, he recalled, had been tried and sentenced to imprisonment for life, but was pardoned by a merciful governor after serving a year of his sentence. As Warwick was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, he could not foresee that, thirty years later, even this would seem an excessive punishment for so slight a misdemeanor.<br><br>Leaving the market-house, Warwick turned to the left, and kept on his course until he reached the next corner. After another turn to the right, a dozen paces brought him in front of a small weather-beaten frame building, from which projected a wooden sign-board bearing the inscription:<br><br>ARCHIBALD STRAIGHT, lawyer.<br><br>He turned the knob, but the door was locked. Retracing his steps past a vacant lot, the young man entered a shop where a colored man was employed in varnishing a coffin, which stood on two trestles in the middle of the floor. Not at all impressed by the melancholy suggestiveness of his task, he was whistling a lively air with great gusto. Upon Warwick&#x2019;s entrance this effusion came to a sudden end, and the coffin-maker assumed an air of professional gravity.<br><br>&#x201c;Good-mawnin&#x2019;, suh,&#x201d; he said, lifting his cap politely.<br><br>&#x201c;Good-morning,&#x201d; answered Warwick. &#x201c;Can you tell me anything about Judge Straight&#x2019;s office hours?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;De ole jedge has be&#x2019;n a little onreg&#x2019;lar sence de wah, suh; but he gin&#x2019;ally gits roun&#x2019; &#x2019;bout ten o&#x2019;clock er so.

An&#x2019; I reckon,&#x201d; continued the undertaker solemnly, his glance unconsciously seeking a row of fine caskets standing against the wall,&#x2014;&#x201c;I reckon he&#x2019;ll soon be goin&#x2019; de way er all de earth. &#x2018;Man dat is bawn er &#x2019;oman hath but a sho&#x2019;t time ter lib, an&#x2019; is full er mis&#x2019;ry.6 He cometh up an&#x2019; is cut down lack as a flower.&#x2019; &#x2018;De days er his life is three-sco&#x2019; an&#x2019; ten&#x2019;&#x2014;an&#x2019; de ole jedge is libbed mo&#x2019; d&#x2019;n dat, suh, by five yeahs, ter say de leas&#x2019;.&#x201d;7<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Death,&#x2019; &#x201d; quoted Warwick, with whose mood the undertaker&#x2019;s remarks were in tune, &#x201c; &#x2018;is the penalty that all must pay for the crime of living.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dat&#x2019;s a fac&#x2019;, suh, dat&#x2019;s a fac&#x2019;; so dey mus&#x2019;&#x2014;so dey mus&#x2019;.

We conduc&#x2019;s de obs&#x2019;quies er all de bes&#x2019; w&#x2019;ite folks er de town, suh.&#x201d;<br><br>Warwick left the undertaker&#x2019;s shop and retraced his steps until he had passed the lawyer&#x2019;s office, toward which he threw an affectionate glance. A few rods farther led him past the old brick Presbyterian church, with its square tower, embowered in a stately grove; past the Catholic church, with its many crosses, and a painted wooden figure of St. James in a recess beneath the gable; and past the old Jefferson House, once the leading hotel of the town, in front of which political meetings had been held, and political speeches made, and political hard cider drunk, in the days of &#x201c;Tippecanoe and Tyler too.&#x201d;8<br><br>The street down which Warwick had come intersected Front Street at a sharp angle in front of the old hotel, forming a sort of flatiron block at the junction, known as Liberty Point,&#x2014;perhaps because slave auctions were sometimes held there in the good old days. Just before Warwick reached Liberty Point, a young woman came down Front Street from the direction of the market-house. When their paths converged, Warwick kept on down Front Street behind her, it having been already his intention to walk in this direction.<br><br>Warwick&#x2019;s first glance had revealed the fact that the young woman was strikingly handsome, with a stately beauty seldom encountered. As he walked along behind her at a measured distance, he could not help noting the details that made up this pleasing impression, for his mind was singularly alive to beauty, in whatever embodiment. The girl&#x2019;s figure, he perceived, was admirably proportioned; she was evidently at the period when the angles of childhood were rounding into the promising curves of adolescence. Her abundant hair, of a dark and glossy brown, was neatly plaited and coiled above an ivory column that rose straight from a pair of gently sloping shoulders, clearly outlined beneath the light muslin frock that covered them.9 He could see that she was tastefully, though not richly, dressed, and that she walked with an elastic step that revealed a light heart and the vigor of perfect health. Her face, of course, he could not analyze, since he had caught only the one brief but convincing glimpse of it.<br><br>The young woman kept on down Front Street, Warwick maintaining his distance a few rods behind her. They passed a factory, a warehouse or two, and then, leaving the brick pavement, walked along on mother earth, under a leafy arcade of spreading oaks and elms. Their way led now through a residential portion of the town, which, as they advanced, gradually declined from staid respectability to poverty, open and unabashed. Warwick observed, as they passed through the respectable quarter, that few people who met the girl greeted her, and that some others whom she passed at gates or doorways gave her no sign of recognition; from which he inferred that she was possibly a visitor in the town and not well acquainted.<br><br>Their walk had continued not more than ten minutes when they crossed a creek by a wooden bridge and came to a row of mean houses standing flush with the street. At the door of one, an old black woman had stooped to lift a large basket, piled high with laundered clothes. The girl, as she passed, seized one end of the basket and helped the old woman to raise it to her head, where it rested solidly on the cushion of her head-kerchief. During this interlude, Warwick, though he had slackened his pace measurably, had so nearly closed the gap between himself and them as to hear the old woman say, with the dulcet negro intonation:<br><br>&#x201c;T&#x2019;ank y&#x2019;, honey; de Lawd gwine bless you sho&#x2019;. You wuz alluz a good gal, and de Lawd love eve&#x2019;ybody w&#x2019;at he&#x2019;p de po&#x2019; ole nigger. You gwine ter hab good luck all yo&#x2019; bawn days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re a true prophet, Aunt Zilphy,&#x201d; laughed the girl in response.<br><br>The sound of her voice gave Warwick a thrill. It was soft and sweet and clear&#x2014;quite in harmony with her appearance. That it had a faint suggestiveness of the old woman&#x2019;s accent he hardly noticed, for the current Southern speech, including his own, was rarely without a touch of it. The corruption of the white people&#x2019;s speech10 was one element&#x2014;only one&#x2014;of the negro&#x2019;s unconscious revenge for his own debasement.<br><br>The houses they passed now grew scattering, and the quarter of the town more neglected. Warwick felt himself wondering where the girl might be going in a neighborhood so uninviting. When she stopped to pull a half-naked negro child out of a mudhole and set him upon his feet, he thought she might be some young lady from the upper part of the town, bound on some errand of mercy, or going, perhaps, to visit an old servant or look for a new one. Once she threw a backward glance at Warwick, thus enabling him to catch a second glimpse of a singularly pretty face. Perhaps the young woman found his presence in the neighborhood as unaccountable as he had deemed hers; for, finding his glance fixed upon her, she quickened her pace with an air of startled timidity.</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Financial Accounting Fundamentals</h2><p>Utilizing the first thirteen chapters of Wild&#39;s best-selling, Financial and Managerial Accounting text, Financial Accounting Fundamentals responds to the market&#39;s request for a low-cost, succinct book; a book that balances large and small businesses, and one that is contemporary, engaging, and accessible for today&#39;s students.

The leading challenger to Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer industry is an operating system called Linux, the product of thousands of volunteer programmers who collaborate over the Internet. The software behind a majority of all the world's web sites doesn't come from a big company either, but from a loosely coordinated group of volunteer programmers called the Apache Group. The Internet itself, and much of its core software, was developed through a process of networked collaboration.The key to these stunning successes is a movement that has come to be called open source, because it depends on the ability of programmers to freely share their program source code so that others can improve it. In 1997, Eric S. Raymond outlined the core principles of this movement in a manifesto called "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," which was published and freely redistributed over the Internet.Mr. Raymond's thinking electrified the computer industry. He argues that the development of the Linux operating system by a loose confederation of thousands of programmers--without central project management or control--turns on its head everything we thought we knew about software project management. Internet-enabled collaboration and free information sharing, not monopolistic control, is the key to innovation and product quality.This idea was interesting to more than programmers and software project leaders. It suggested a whole new way of doing business, and the possibility of unprecedented shifts in the power structures of the computer industry.The rush to capitalize on the idea of open source started with Netscape's decision to release its flagship Netscape Navigator product under open source licensing terms in early 1998. Before long, Fortune 500 companies like Intel, IBM, and Oracle were joining the party. By August 1999, when the leading Linux distributor, Red Hat Software, made its hugely successful public stock offering, it had become clear that open source was "the next big thing" in the computer industry.This revolutionary book starts out with "A Brief History of Hackerdom"--the historical roots of the open-source movement--and details the events that led to the recognition of the power of open source. It contains the full text of "The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar," updated and expanded for this book, plus Mr. Raymond's other key essays on the social and economic dynamics of open source software development.Open source is the competitive advantage in the Internet Age. <i>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</i> is a must for anyone who cares about the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come.</p></p><p>It may be foolish to consider Eric Raymond's recent collection of essays, <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>, the most important computer programming thinking to follow the Internet revolution. But it would be more unfortunate to overlook the implications and long-term benefits of his fastidious description of open-source software development considering the growing dependence businesses and economies have on emerging computer technologies.<p> <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i> takes its title from an essay Raymond read at the 1997 Linux Kongress. The essay documents Raymond's acquisition, re-creation, and numerous revisions of an e-mail utility known as <i>fetchmail</i>. Raymond engagingly narrates the fetchmail development process while elaborating on the ongoing bazaar development method he uses with the help of volunteer programmers. The essay smartly spares the reader from the technical morass that could easily detract from the text's goal of demonstrating the efficacy of the open-source, or bazaar, method in creating robust, usable software.</p><p> Once Raymond has established the components and players necessary for an optimally running open-source model, he sets out to counter the conventional wisdom of private, closed-source software development. Like superbly written code, the author's arguments systematically anticipate their rebuttals. For programmers who "worry that the transition to open source will abolish or devalue their jobs," Raymond adeptly and factually counters that "most developer's salaries don't depend on software sale value." Raymond's uncanny ability to convince is as unrestrained as his capacity for extrapolating upon the promise of open-source development.</p><p> In addition to outlining the open-source methodology and its benefits, Raymond also sets out to salvage the <i>hacker</i> moniker from the nefarious connotations typically associated with it in his essay, "A Brief History of Hackerdom" (not surprisingly, he is also the compiler of <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i>). Recasting hackerdom in a more positive light may be a heroic undertaking in itself, but considering the Herculean efforts and perfectionist motivations of Raymond and his fellow open-source developers, that light will shine brightly. <i>--Ryan Kuykendall</i></p><p>Eric Raymond is an Open Source evangelist and author of the highly influential paper "The Cathedral and the Bazaar".</p></p><h2>Because Teaching Matters: An Introduction to the Profession</h2><p>Real challenges.

Jean Baudrillard has succeeded in all of this and more. Now, in his latest book, Baudrillard presents his most popular themes--symbolic exchange, hyper-reality, technology and war--and applies them to the current global conflict between "the West and the Rest", including Islam. Ultimately, it is not simply about the war against terror but about the bigger picture of capitalism versus everything else. This book serves as the summation of Baudrillard's work over the last twenty years and is the essential analysis of the fundamental conflict of our time.<br></p><p><b>Jean Baudrillard</b> is one of the most influential philosophical and cultural critics writing today. His books include <i>Simulacra and Simulation</i>, <i>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</i>, <i>America</i>, <i>Seduction</i>, <i>The System of Objects</i>, <i>Cool Memories</i>, <i>Symbolic Exchange and Death </i>and <i>The Transparency of Evil</i>. <b></b><br><b></b> <br><b>Chris Turner</b> has translated many of the key works of French theory over the last two decades, particularly the work of Baudrillard, including most recently, <i>The Spirit of Terrorism</i>.<br>Praise for Jean Baudrillard:<br>"When it comes to mysterious paradoxes and lyrical complexity no French intellectual matches Jean Baudrillard in contemplating the New World ... a sharp-shooting Lone Ranger of the post-Marxist left."--<i>New York Times</i><br>"The most important French thinker of the past twenty years."--J.G.

Ballard<br>"Baudrillard foresaw the allure of virtual reality long before William Gibson; he was in the vanguard of Marxian critiques of modern consumerism; before it became fashionable, he wrote a scintillating analysis of man's sentimental exploitation of animals. Baudrillard got there first, many times. And now his self-imposed task is to shock us into realising that thought and the world need not be as they are."--<i>The Guardian</i><br></p><h2>Toward a Psychology of Being, 3rd Edition</h2><p>"If we wish to help humans to become more fully human, we must realize not only that they try to realize themselves, but that they are also reluctant or afraid or unable to do so. Only by fully appreciating this dialectic between sickness and health can we help to tip the balance in favor of health." -Abraham Maslow<br> Abraham Maslow's theories of self-actualization and the hierarchy of human needs are the cornerstone of modern humanistic psychology, and no book so well epitomizes those ideas as his classic Toward a Psychology of Being.<br> A profound book, an exciting book, its influence continues to spread, more than a quarter century after its author's death, beyond psychology and throughout the humanities, social theory, and business management theory.<br> Of course, the book's enduring popularity stems from the important questions it raises and the answers it provides concerning what is fundamental to human nature and psychological well-being, and what is needed to promote, maintain, and restore mental and emotional well-being. But its success also has to do with Maslow's unique ability to convey difficult philosophical concepts with passion, precision, and astonishing clarity, and, through the power of his words, to ignite in readers a sense of creative joy and wholeness toward which we, as beings capable of self-actualization, strive.<br> This Third Edition makes Abraham Maslow's ideas accessible to a new generation of psychology students, as well as businesspeople, managers, and trainers interested in applying the study of human behavior to management techniques.<br> An energetic and articulate scholar, Professor Maslow was the author of more than twenty books, including Eupsychian Management; Psychology of Science; Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences; Motivation and Personality; and Principles of Abnormal Psychology (with B. Mittelmann). He also edited New Knowledge in Human Values and wrote nearly one hundred articles. His teachings continue to be a staple for psychologists and psychology students.<br> "Capacities clamor to be used, and cease their clamor only when they are well used. . . . Not only is it fun to use our capacities, but it is necessary for growth. The unused skill or capacity or organ can become a disease center or else atrophy or disappear, thus diminishing the person." -Abraham Maslow<br> Toward a Psychology of Being, Third Edition<br> Abraham Maslow doesn't pretend to have easy answers, absolutes, or solutions that bring the relief of finality-but he does have a deep belief in people. In this Third Edition of Toward a Psychology of Being (the original edition sold well over 100,000 copies), there is a constant optimistic thrust toward a future based on the intrinsic values of humanity. Professor Maslow states that, "This inner nature, as much as we know of it so far, seems not to be intrinsically evil, but rather either neutral or positively 'good.' What we call evil behavior appears most often to be a secondary reaction to frustration of this intrinsic nature." He demonstrates that human beings can be loving, noble, and creative, and are capable of pursuing the highest values and aspirations.<br> This Third Edition will bring Professor Maslow's ideas to a whole new generation of business and psychology readers, as well as anyone interested in the study of human behavior.</p><p>ABRAHAM H. MASLOW, PhD (1908-70), was born in Brooklyn, New York, and educated at the City College of New York and the University of Wisconsin. Before assuming his post as Chairman of the Department of Psychology at Brandeis University in 1951, he taught for fourteen years at Brooklyn College. Dr. Maslow also served as President of the American Psychological Association from 1967-68.</p><h2>Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government (Princeton Studies in Political Behavior, 4)</h2><p><p><i>Democracy for Realists</i> assails the romantic folk-theory at the heart of contemporary thinking about democratic politics and government, and offers a provocative alternative view grounded in the actual human nature of democratic citizens.</p><p>Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels deploy a wealth of social-scientific evidence, including ingenious original analyses of topics ranging from abortion politics and budget deficits to the Great Depression and shark attacks, to show that the familiar ideal of thoughtful citizens steering the ship of state from the voting booth is fundamentally misguided. They demonstrate that voters&#x2015;even those who are well informed and politically engaged&#x2015;mostly choose parties and candidates on the basis of social identities and partisan loyalties, not political issues. They also show that voters adjust their policy views and even their perceptions of basic matters of fact to match those loyalties. When parties are roughly evenly matched, elections often turn on irrelevant or misleading considerations such as economic spurts or downturns beyond the incumbents' control; the outcomes are essentially random. Thus, voters do not control the course of public policy, even indirectly.</p><p>Achen and Bartels argue that democratic theory needs to be founded on identity groups and political parties, not on the preferences of individual voters. Now with new analysis of the 2016 elections, <i>Democracy for Realists</i> provides a powerful challenge to conventional thinking, pointing the way toward a fundamentally different understanding of the realities and potential of democratic government.</p></p><p><p>"Two of America's smartest political scientists bid fair to transform our understanding of democracy. In our season of democratic discontent, this unsettling book could hardly be more timely. Must-reading for anyone interested in democratic theory and American politics."<b>--Robert D. Putnam, author of <i>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</i> and <i>Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis</i></b></p><p>"<i>Democracy for Realists</i> is the single most important treatise on American democracy published in several decades. Achen and Bartels challenge just about every existing school of thought about electoral politics, policymaking, and government performance. They do not conclude with a counsel of despair for the future of American democracy, but they give no quarter to any notion that responsive government is possible without a more responsible citizenry."<b>--John DiIulio, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"It is impossible to overstate the significance of this magnum opus on democracy and democratic theory.

Mann, Brookings Institution and the University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"It is common in the history of science for scholars to bark up the wrong trees. Achen and Bartels make a strong case that spatial models of mass elections and the theory of retrospective voting are examples of wrong trees. Scholars, they argue, should now reorient toward group attachments as the foundation of democratic politics. All in all, this is a broad, deeply thoughtful, and courageous book."<b>--John Zaller, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"Not since the work of Walter Lippmann, David Truman, Philip Converse, and Robert Dahl have empirical democratic theorists made us think so deeply. Achen and Bartels demolish the folk theory of democracy in which politicians obtain mandates from rational voters. Instead, they propose an exciting new agenda that wrestles with the real democratic process in which political parties and interest groups fashion public policies to appeal to people's basic identities."<b>--Henry E.

Several twentieth-century myths about particle physics, Einstein&#x2019;s theory of relativity, and more are discredited here as well.

Because the background for this fifth published novel was a strike of migrant pickers in California&#x2019;s apple orchards, it was assumed to be one of the &#x201c;proletarian&#x201d; novels of the period supporting radical causes if not actually promoting the changing line of the Communist Party. The powerful California growers&#x2019; associations that he attacked suspected him of being a card-carrying contributor to the &#x201c;red conspiracy&#x201d; that had been viewed as a threat to American traditions since World War I.</p><p>Steinbeck wrote to a friend, however, just after completing the novel, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like communists, either. I mean I dislike them as people. I rather imagine the apostles had the same waspish qualities and the New Testament is proof that they had equally bad manners&#x201d;&#x2014;an attitude that he maintained throughout his life.* Earlier he had written to another struggling novelist, George Albee: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in strikes as a means of raising men&#x2019;s wages, and I&#x2019;m not interested in ranting about justice and oppression, mere outcroppings which indicate the condition....The book is brutal. I wanted to be merely a recording consciousness, judging nothing, simply putting down the thing.&#x201d; Readers will discover that he could not maintain such a detached perspective; yet at a time when the world raged with fanatical struggles between &#x201c;true believers,&#x201d; he was successful in refusing to serve any organized party or special interest group and becoming an ideologue.</p><p>Ironically, the first controversy over <i>In Dubious Battle</i> was generated not by conservative critics who would later be outraged by <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> but by a radical sympathizer in New York who almost destroyed the rewarding association that Steinbeck had just begun to enjoy with publisher Pascal Covici. Their collaboration looked to promise Steinbeck the security and recognition that he had been seeking since 1929.</p><p>Steinbeck had decided to become a professional writer when he entered high school at the age of fifteen in his home town of Salinas, California; but before he emerged from obscurity and attained international celebrity, he had to survive a long, frustrating apprenticeship. His first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i>, a swashbuckling tale of the Spanish Main, was not published until he was twenty-seven&#x2014;in October 1929, just weeks before the stock market crash brought on the Great Depression. Written in an affected style influenced by such now-forgotten favorites of the flamboyant 1920s as Donn-Byrne&#x2019;s <i>Messer Marco Polo</i>, Rafael Sabatini&#x2019;s <i>Captain Blood</i> and James Branch Cabell&#x2019;s scandalous <i>Jurgen</i>, this historical romance enjoyed a modest, shortlived run, but it quickly disappeared from the market when the publisher became one of the many bankruptcy victims of the time. Steinbeck&#x2019;s next two works&#x2014;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932), a story-cycle set in his native region of contemporary California, and a mystical fantasy called <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933)&#x2014;followed the same route, along with their publishers.</p><p>Steinbeck had completed a fourth novel, <i>Tortilla Flat</i>, which was circulating among publishers without success, and was already deeply engaged on another, which would become <i>In Dubious Battle</i>, when late in 1933, Ben Abramson, proprietor of Chicago&#x2019;s Argus Bookshop and an enthusiastic advocate of Steinbeck&#x2019;s work, pressed a copy of <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> on Pascal Covici, partner in the New York publishing firm Covici-Friede, Inc. Covici, who had never before heard of Steinbeck, shared Abramson&#x2019;s enthusiasm and sat up all night reading the ironic short-story cycle. He had Steinbeck&#x2019;s agent send him the manuscript of <i>Tortilla Flat</i> and at once offered to publish this droll cycle of stories about Mexican-Americans leading a scandalously marginal life in the semi-wooded outskirts of Monterey, California. Covici took an option on Steinbeck&#x2019;s future works and promised to reissue the earlier novels. At last, things seemed to have turned around for Steinbeck.</p><p>Unfortunately, the manuscript of <i>In Dubious Battle</i> arrived at Covici&#x2019;s office while the publisher was out of town promoting <i>Tortilla Flat.</i> The manuscript fell into the hands of an editor with communist sympathies who rejected it because he considered the marxist ideology of the strike organizers inaccurate. He felt that Steinbeck did not know what he was talking about and that the novel would offend people at both ends of the political spectrum.</p><p>The rejection invalidated Steinbeck&#x2019;s contract with Covici and infuriated the author, who wrote to his agent:</p><p></p><p>Between you and me I suspect a strong communist bias in that office, since the reasons given against the book are all those I have heard from communists of the intellectual bent and of the Jewish race....My information for this book came mostly from Irish and Italian communists whose training was in the field, not in the drawing room. They don&#x2019;t believe in ideologies and ideal tactics.</p><p></p><p>While Steinbeck felt only contempt for those he called New York &#x201c;parlor pinks,&#x201d; <i>In Dubious Battle</i> attracted a number of bids from other publishers. When an outraged Covici learned what had happened, he fired the editor and wrote to Steinbeck offering to publish the novel at once. The author decided to stay with Covici, and they worked together for the rest of Steinbeck&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Steinbeck placed such great emphasis on his sources and the accuracy of their firsthand information because he had originally planned this book, based on the experiences of strike leader Pat Chambers, to be a first-person diary of a labor organizer working in the field. His literary agents, however, suggested that he use the material as the basis for a novel instead, as it would probably prove more popular with his new audience, as well as less likely to cause trouble with possibly offended parties on both sides of the disputes. Excited about the project, Steinbeck turned out 120,000 words in five months, beginning early in September 1934, only weeks after the notorious Bloody Thursday (mentioned several times in the text), July 5, 1934, when San Francisco police made international headlines by shooting two people and wounding many others in an effort to break up a longshoremen&#x2019;s strike. The eyes of the world were on the turbulent scene in California for another reason: social-protest novelist Upton Sinclair was conducting a strident campaign for the state&#x2019;s governorship based on his EPIC (End Poverty in California) share-the-wealth plan.</p><p>When <i>In Dubious Battle</i> was published in 1936, Steinbeck was surprised that this novel, which he had thought most readers would find objectionably grim and controversial, reached the best-seller lists. It also received surprisingly few hostile reviews from critics on either the political right or left. The most conspicuous exception to this favorable consensus was Mary McCarthy&#x2019;s denunciation of the novel as &#x201c;academic, wooden, inert&#x201d; and of Steinbeck as &#x201c;certainly no philosopher, sociologist, or strike technician.&#x201d; She was then a recent Vassar graduate writing for <i>The Nation</i> and would not publish the first of her own chicly cynical satires until 1942; but her attitude started a feud that lasted the rest of Steinbeck&#x2019;s life.</p><p>II</p><p>Despite the unforeseen success of the novel, Steinbeck remained annoyed that the interest in it was mostly political, as indeed he had predicted. Readers&#x2019; attention focused upon what the author considered &#x201c;mere outcroppings&#x201d;&#x2014;like local strikes&#x2014;rather than what he considered the underlying problems of human greed and inhumane behavior toward other humans as a result of lack of understanding. The situation in California, however, where entrenched interests looked upon themselves as defending the last frontier in &#x201c;the land of opportunity,&#x201d; seemed to a worried world to be verging on class warfare.</p><p>Steinbeck does not appear to have taken much interest in Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s gubernatorial campaign, nor was he particularly familiar with the reformer&#x2019;s many fictional expos�s of corruption in American industry. Sinclair&#x2019;s lurid but often pedestrianly written naturalism was probably the kind of &#x201c;realism&#x201d; that Steinbeck often objected to in letters to his friends during the 1930s, when he continued to speak of his own predilection for fantasy and the &#x201c;metaphysical.&#x201d; Steinbeck sought to probe beneath the superficialities of partisan contentiousness, but readers were moved by his emotionally powerful rendering of violent episodes in the world around them. Two such episodes evoked in the novel would still have been fresh in readers&#x2019; minds when it appeared.</p><p>The older and most fanatical characters in the novel, like old Joy, are surviving &#x201c;Wobblies,&#x201d; members of the radical Industrial Workers of the World (or IWW), organized in 1905 when the craft-oriented American Federation of Labor seemed insufficiently concerned about unskilled manual laborers. Despite the IWW&#x2019;s insistence that it was not a syndicalist organization advocating violent overthrow of governments, it was widely suspected of seeking to bring industry and government under workingmen&#x2019;s control by revolutionary means if necessary. It grew rapidly in ten years and became a much-feared force, especially in the Pacific North-west lumber country; but the union quickly lost support when it militantly opposed American participation in World War I. It was almost destroyed by a wide-scale persecution beginning in 1922, when it became a special target of President Harding&#x2019;s attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, and his campaign against a &#x201c;red conspiracy.&#x201d; Though widely outlawed, the IWW was still in operation throughout the 1930s; and parents, especially in rural western communities like the one in which Steinbeck grew up at the height of its activities, still evoked threats of &#x201c;Wobblies&#x201d; as bogeymen to control unruly children.</p><p>Of more immediate and even more frightening concern was the strike that had closed down the port of San Francisco in 1934. Organized by Harry Bridges, an Australian labor leader, it began on May 9 as a walkout by rank-and-file members of the International Longshoremen&#x2019;s Association who were dissatisfied with their officers&#x2019; suspected collusion with employers. Other labor organizations joined in, threatening a general strike that might paralyze the city. On July 3 the police were ordered to try to infiltrate and secure the docks, in civic authorities&#x2019; anticipation that the national holiday the following day would create a lull that might lead to a gradual disintegration of the strike. On July 5&#x2014;Bloody Thursday&#x2014;however, the confrontation resumed with new vehemence. The police killed two protesters and wounded some seventy others at the scene.</p><p>The governor called out the National Guard the next day and appealed to the federal government to send in troops to protect property. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was on vacation at the time, bound for Hawaii on a U.S. Navy vessel; Secretary of State Cordell Hull had been left in charge in Washington. Hull panicked and decided to appeal to the president for an executive order to use federal troops. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, mindful of President Hoover&#x2019;s order to General Douglas MacArthur in 1932 to fire on the war veteran bonus marchers in Washington, objected that this would be the worst possible course to follow. Through Roosevelt&#x2019;s personal secretary, Perkins managed to get a message to the president, who agreed with her that the federal government should not become involved.

But now, acrimony is not confined to a moment; it's a permanent state of affairs and has seeped into every part of the political process. Identifying the overriding problems that have led Congress&#x2014;and the United States&#x2014;to the brink of institutional collapse, <i>It's Even Worse Than It Looks</i> profoundly altered the debate about why America's government has become so dysfunctional. Through a new preface and afterword, Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein bring the story forward, examining the 2012 presidential campaign and exploring the prospects of a less dysfunctional government. As provocative and controversial as ever, <i>It's Even Worse Than It Looks</i> will continue to set the terms of our political debate in the years to come.<br></p><p>THOMAS E. MANN is the W. Averell Harriman Chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. He is a former executive director of the American Political Science Association.

He is also the author of a weekly column for <i>Roll Call</i> called ''Congress Inside Out.''He lives in Washington, DC.''The phrase 'essential reading' does not begin to get at the importance of this passionate warning by two of our very best political scientists about our nation's capacity to govern itself. Mann and Ornstein sweep aside the timid conventional wisdom to inform Americans that our problems are even worse than we think they are. It is absolutely vital that this book's findings and message enter the consciousness and consciences of journalists, politicians, and citizens who care about the future of our republic.'' --E. J. Dionne, National Book Award nominee<br><br>''This is an exceptionally important and cogent analysis of America's breakdown in self-governance. It is an urgent warning of the consequences of our intolerant politics and governing paralysis and ways to fix it.'' --Chuck Hagel, former US senator and distinguished professor, Georgetown University<br><br>''One doesn't have to agree with every one of Mann and Ornstein's proposals to appreciate the extraordinary contribution to improving governance that they make in this important book. We could do no better than to use it as a compelling blueprint for urgently needed reform. If every member of Congress would read just one book on the subject, my wish is that it would be this one.'' --Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader<br><br> ''More than any time in my lifetime, the United States is challenged at home and so is our place in the world. When Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein get together to sound a loud alarm about the way our political system is being torn apart, it's time to listen -- and listen hard. Then the tough part -- how do we restore some sense of common purpose, of working together to make our government work? Mann and Ornstein set out ways to rebuild political bridges, beginning right now. We'd better get to work.'' --Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve</p><h2>Critical Thinking Activities in Patterns, Imagery &amp; Logic / Grades 4-6 (Blackline Masters)</h2><p>Too often, thinking skills have been overlooked or considered extra, something above and beyond the basic that must be taught.

It provides invaluable analysis and contextualisation of her work alongside such New York City contemporaries as Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein and other denizens of the Tenth Street milieu of the 1950s. Emerging from the shadow of Abstract Expressionism, Dodd and this circle cleaved to an observational painting based in the early modernist tradition. Beginning in the 1950s, Lois Dodd has steadfastly pursued her observational painting, remaining aloof from passing trends. She is widely admired as a &#x2018;painter&#x2019;s painter&#x2019; whose landscapes and city scenes display subtle effects of place, light and weather within graphically distilled compositions. Dodd&#x2019;s works capture the intangible character of changing seasons or particular hours of day in locations throughout New York City, rural New Jersey and Maine, but the paintings betray no mark of era. They are curiously timeless. Through extensive studio visits and interviews, Faye Hirsch considers the processes, places and impulses behind Dodd&#x2019;s paintings and reveals her outwardly peaceful, reflective canvases to be the product of an alert and forceful eye and a powerfully efficient execution.</p><p><b>Faye Hirsch</b> is an author, curator and critic who has published widely on contemporary art.

He teaches at the New School in New York.</p>Using numerous examples of clear, stylish writing from a broad range of disciplines, and adding the warmth of his personal experiences, Zinsser makes a strong case for his claim that writing about a field of knowledge is the best way to immerse oneself in it and to make it one's own. Three guiding principles emergeaccuracy, brevity, and clarityand, Zinsser argues, writers who keep them in mind will avoid much of the misunderstanding that results from bad writing. Zinnser has particularly harsh words for what he calls "corporation-speak," the incomprehensible nonsense that invades many professional publications.

Evidence-Based Nursing enables students to understand and evaluate different types of studies and how they contribute research evidence, how patient care and outcomes can be improved through using research in clinical decision making, and how research findings can be disseminated and implemented in clinical practice.<b>Nicky Cullum</b> is Director of the Centre for Evidence Based Nursing at the University of York, UK and formerly UK Editor of Evidence Based Nursing. <p><b>Donna Ciliska</b> is Professor, School of Nursing, McMaster University ,Canada, and Editor, Evidence-Based Nursing</p> <p><b>Brian Haynes</b> is Professor and Chair, Clinical Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics and Medicine, McMaster University, Canada and Co-ordinating Editor, Evidence Based Nursing</p> <p><b>Susan Marks</b> is Senior Research Associate, Evidence Based Nursing.</p></p><h2>Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation</h2><p>John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy over &#34;multiculturalism&#34; and the current &#34;crisis of the humanities.&#34; Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu&#39;s sociology, Guillory argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution of &#34;cultural capital&#34; in the schools, which regulate access to literacy, to the practices of reading and writing.</p><p>In Cultural Capital, John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy over &#34;multiculturalism&#34; and the current &#34;crisis of the humanities&#34;. Guillory argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of representing social groups in the canon than of distributing &#34;cultural capital&#34; in the schools, which regulate access to literacy, the practices of reading and writing. He declines to reduce the history of canon formation to one of individual reputations or the ideological contents of particular works, arguing that a critique of the canon fixated on the concept of authorial identity overlooks historical transformations in the forms of cultural capital that have underwritten judgments of individual authors. The most important of these transformations is the emergence of &#34;literature&#34; in the later eighteenth century as the name of the cultural capital of the bourgeoisie. In three case studies, Guillory charts the rise and decline of the category of &#34;literature&#34; as the organizing principle of canon formation in the modern period. He considers the institutionalization of the English vernacular canon in eighteenth-century primary schools; the polemic on behalf of a New Critical modernist canon in the university; and the appearance of a &#34;canon of theory&#34; supplementing the literary curriculum in the graduate schools and marking the onset of a terminal crisis of literature as the dominant form of cultural capital in the schools. The final chapter ofCultural Capital examines recent theories of value judgment, which have strongly reaffirmed cultural relativism as the necessary implication of canon critique. Contrasting the relativist position with Pierre Bourdieu&#39;s very different sociology of judgment, Guillory concludes that the object of a revisionary critique of aesthetic evaluation should not be to discredit judgment, but to reform the conditions of its practice in the schools by universalizing access to the means of literary production and consumption.</p><h2>ADTs, Data Structures, and Problem Solving with C++</h2><p><p><b></b> Reflecting the newest trends in computer science, new and revised material throughout the Second Edition of this book places increased emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs) and object-oriented design. <b></b> This book continues to offer a thorough, well-organized, and up-to-date presentation of essential principles and practices in data structures using C++.

He joins forces with Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, a former nobleman who has returned to his hometown to find a cache of missing jewels which were hidden in some chairs that have been appropriated by the Soviet authorities. The search for the bejeweled chairs takes these unlikely heroes from the provinces to Moscow to the wilds of Soviet Georgia and the Trans-caucasus mountains; on their quest they encounter a wide variety of characters: from opportunistic Soviet bureaucrats to aging survivors of the prerevolutionary propertied classes, each one more selfish, venal, and ineffective than the one before.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>When Someone You Love Is Depressed: How to Help Your Loved One Without Losing Yourself</h2><p>The authors show family and friends of people suffering from depression how to understand their own reactions and feelings, how to avoid the damage depression can cause a relationship, and how to help their loved ones. 75,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><b>Praise for<br> <i>When Someone You Love Is Depressed</i>:</b> <p> "Insidious and, in its fashion, communicable, depression is an ailment of underappreciated destructive power. Doctors Rosen and Amador perform a valuable service by posing the important question: How do you cope with depression when it intrudes on an intimate relationship? Their answers contain practical wisdom that will allow readers to make concrete decisions affecting their own well-being and that of someone they love."<br> -- Peter Kramer, author of <i>Listening to Prozac</i> </p><p> "This is the first book to detail the effect of depression on relationships and to offer concrete, clear advice on how to help a depressed person. It is a remarkably balanced, well-written, and encouraging piece of work that will undoubtedly help millions of people and become an invaluable resource."<br> -- Jack M. Gorman, M.D., author of <i>The Essential Guide to Psychiatric Drugs</i> and <i>The New Psychiatry</i> </p><p> </p> <p> Although numerous books have been written for those suffering from depression, until now none of them has addressed the "secondary" victims of this debilitating disease: the loved ones of the depressed. If someone you love is depressed, you undoubtedly recognize that the depression has placed some new burdens on you; however you may be affected in more ways than you realize. Research shows that if you are close to a depressed person, you are at a much higher risk of developing problems yourself, including anxiety, phobias, and even a kind of contagious depression. Yet, too often, those of us who care about a depressed person are so focused on their needs that we don't realize that we might need help. There is startling evidence that marriages in which one person is depressed are nine times more likely to end in divorce; that children with a depressed parent are at an increased risk for a range of adjustment difficulties; and that if you are caring for an elderly depressed parent, your physical and mental health are likely to suffer. </p><p> Depression is also notorious for causing increased misunderstandings and sexual problems in intimate relationships. Laura Rosen and Xavier Amador, psychologists with expertise in treating the secondary victims of depression, explain the mechanisms of depression that can cause communication breakdown, increase hostility, and ultimately destroy relationships. Rather than just explaining these secondary effects of depression, the authors teach you concrete methods that you and your loved one can use to protect yourselves and your relationship from depression's impact. </p><p> Through compelling real life stories and step-by-step advice, Rosen and Amador show how you can express your feelings and get your needs met while strengthening your relationship; how you can provide the kind of support that is most helpful in recovery from depression; and how you can encourage the depressed person to seek treatment. Drawing on their own innovative research, the authors give sensitive advice about how to recognize your needs, and how to find the best help for yourself and your loved one. Whether you are the partner, parent, friend, or child of a depressed person, you'll find this book an invaluable companion in your journey back to health.END</p>Laura Epstein Rosen, Ph.D. is Supervisor of Family Therapy Training at the Special Needs Clinic of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.</p><h2>The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.</h2><p>In this book, the world&#39;s foremost color theorist examines two different approaches to understanding the art of color. Subjective feelings and objective color principles are described in detail and clarified by color reproductions.</p><p>What would the world be without color? A dull, joyless melange of shapes without vital meaning. "Color is life, for a world without color seems dead. As a flame produces light, light produces color. As intonation lends color to the spoken word, color lends spiritually realized sound to form." - Johannes Itten. Over the years numerous color theories have been published: Goethe's theory of color is as famous as Ostwald's color cirlce. Adolf Holzel exercised an important influence on modern art with his theory of color. Now with his ART OF COLOR Johannes Itten makes a contribution. Using Holzel's theory as a springboard, Itten has expanded and developed it along his own original lines. Although never published before, the Itten theory already underlies progressive art education all over the world. In this book Itten examines two different approaches to understanding the art of color. Subjective feelings and objective color principles are the two poles which are described in detail and clarified with numerous color reproductions. The key to this knowledge lies in the color circle and the seven color contrasts which are found on pages 35-109. The problems of visual, emotional and symbolic color effects are carefully explored with numerous color illustrations. The systematic color exercises are followed by outstanding reproductions of paintings by the great masters - 28 large size, four-color plates - which offer insight into all the epochs of Western painting from the early Middle Ages to Klee and Picasso. With each reproduction is one of Professor Itten's famous analyses which proves how conscious awareness and use of color contrast has been an important means of expression. In the chapter, THEORY OF COLOR EXPRESSION (page 130), the psychic and emotional values expressed by color are examined and explained. This gives an extraordinary approach to the understanding of expressionistic painting. Another important chapter, COMPOSITION (page 144), contains the goal of the whole theory of color for the creative artist. It also represents the crowning point of the book for the viewer of art. According to Itten composition implies brining two or more colors together in such a way that they harmonize to give an expression unambiguous and full of character. When preparing the first printing of THE ART OF COLOR in 1960, author and publisher were faced with the problem of finding the most favorable method of producing the difficult color reproductions. It could only be done by producing the various color plates by entirely different printing processes, which had to be done by several printers, and then tipping them into the book. <p> When a reprinting was planned in 1973, it had by then become possible to make use of the advanced technical developments in offset printing, and the entire book was produced by this printing process. Altogether great care was taken to preserve the excellence of the original edition, Contents and order of pages were retained, some of the illustrations were enlarged and veracity was improved as far as the existing material allowed. Our aim for this new printing was to once again make available in its best form Johannes Itten's color course, while at the same time strictly adhering to his principles of presentation.</p>Johannes Itten (1888-1967) concerned himself with the problems of color all his life. After completing his studies as a teacher, he was able to gain firs knowledge of color theory in Stuttgart, from 1913 to 1916, in the circle of Adolf Holzel. He tested and modified this theory in his own artistic labors, as well as in intensive studies of all available color theories. Johannes Itten treated the problem of color, which present themselves to the painter who works with color as an artist and craftsman the way the scientist explores the physical and chemical properties of color. <p>The significance of Johannes Itten's own artistic achievements as one of the great contributions to the art of the 20th century is undisputed. His color theory, which was condensed in The Art of Color, convincingly synthesized the knowledge of the great painter and the experience of the progressive educator, two poles that stamped Itten's personality. His theory has been thoroughly disseminated all over the world, in many versions and languages. </p><p>The subjective perceptual experience and objective laws of color produce a tension of opposites shown in this book by many examples in color. A comprehensive knowledge of the objective laws is required to grow beyond the subjective laws of color is required to grow beyond the subjective narrowness of conception which is everybody's preliminary approach to the manifestations of color in everyday life and art. Itten fully understood these difficulties. The knowledge of the objective laws of color can be grasped in the color sphere and the seven color contrasts, both of which are derived from the color circle. The problems of impressionistic and expressionistic effects of color are examined in many juxtapositions of examples in color. The foundation of color composition is found through color harmony. After the color exercises, there are reproductions and analysis if the paintings of great masters, old, and new, which testify to the validity of Itten's book and its teachings.</p></p><h2>Murder at the Manor: Country House Mysteries (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"[T]he entire book is filled with country-house-mystery wonders: the closed-circle puzzle, the dying-message clue, and the sociopathic guest who invades the weekend house party." &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p><p>The English country house is an iconic setting for some of the greatest British crime fiction. This new collection gathers together stories written over a span of about 65 years, during which British society, and life in country houses, was transformed out of all recognition. It includes fascinating and unfamiliar twists on the classic 'closed circle' plot, in which the assorted guests at a country house party become suspects when a crime is committed. In the more sinister tales featured here, a gloomy mansion set in lonely grounds offers an eerie backdrop for dark deeds.</p><p>Many distinguished writers are represented in this collection, including such great names of the genre as Anthony Berkeley, Nicholas Blake and G.K. Chesterton. Martin Edwards has also unearthed hidden gems and forgotten masterpieces: among them are a fine send-up of the country house murder; a suspenseful tale by the unaccountably neglected Ethel Lina White; and a story by the little-known Scottish writer J.J. Bell.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F. Keating and Macavity awards for the year's best book about the genre.</p>Actually, the stories were quite entertaining The stories were written by a variety of authors and the the compiler of the stories thoughtfully provided information about each author which certainly added to the enjoyment. I did find one story down right scary, but perhaps because that was partly because I was reading that one late at night. Most of the stories would fit into the "cozy" category....My favorite was Murder at the Towers which I found delightfully written and with a twist that I could NEVER have imagined. E. V. Knox had amusing names for the characters like "Police-Inspector Blowhard." The writing for this one had me longing for more. It is set in a house party in a grand home in England (of course - the book is titled "Murder at the Manor") The first sentence is one of the best opening lines I have ever read. Mr. Ponderby-Wilkins was a man so rich, so ugly, so cross, and so old, that even the stupidest reader could not expect him to survive any longer than Chapter 1." Our detective is introduced and was welcomed by all the guests. "Many of them had already begun to feel that a house-party without a detective in it must be regarded as a literary failure....My problem was not with the stories or the writing, but with the format. I read this on my kindle; it was the first time I had ever read short stories in e-format. I found this disconcerting. I couldn't be certain while reading how much longer a story was; I couldn't just flip a few pages easily and see how much more 'til the end. The stories were of varying length so I had no idea. My kindle only would show the % until the end of the book. I wasn't even certain just how many stories were included in this anthology....While I highly recommend the book, I would advise anyone who wants to read it, to buy the traditional bound copy. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>For the last several months I've been enjoying these short stories whose publishing history ranges roughly over sixty-five years, the heyday of the British country house mystery, written by names still famous today, and writers once famed and now fading....Martin Edwards has written an engaging and informative introduction, and at the start of each story gives more specifics about each writer, highlighting their most famous works, and sometimes why this particular story was chosen. I was glad to see that the anthology was not comprised of the most famous stories by each author, often seen in many anthologies; though I recognized a number of authorial names, every one of the stories was new to me....The early ones show the relative roughness of the form as mystery writers were beginning to assemble their tropes. Somewhere along the line the English mystery shifted from its pulpy origins to an acceptable literary game for the respected auteur, though the funniest story in the entire group, penned by E.V. Knox (brother of Ronald Knox, and editor of Punch) pokes fun at the subgenre with a hilarious deftness. The prose and characterizations show a steady advancement in polish and sophistication over the course of the anthology, though those early ones are not without charm and vigor....The anthology offers a wide range of types of country house mysteries, from horror to psychological puzzle, locked room to dying clue; female writers as well as male, though male writers (and sleuths) form the preponderance here. Some of these sleuths are posh, others everyman; they range from two-fisted adventurers to plump bon vivants, and of course there are the police and Scotland Yard detectives....Altogether it's a winner of an anthology, even for someone--like me--who doesn't read many mysteries. I found myself intrigued by the variety as well as the introductory data (which sent me looking up some promising reads that I never otherwise would have heard of), and I enjoyed the bite-sized tales, suitable for reading in a single evening when one is too tired, or too distracted, to sink into the length of a novel....Because there was an effort made to select lesser-known works by famous people, as well as significant stories by lesser-known writers, I would say that this anthology would appeal to the dedicated mystery reader as well as to the now-and-then mystery reader like me. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>4.5 stars Murder at the Manor is an anthology of short stories celebrating the British country house mystery. This collection gathers together stories written over a span of roughly sixty-five years....The book starts with a short history of the use of country houses in murder stories and also includes a brief background on each of the authors....I loved this anthology of 16 neatly crafted, traditional whodunit cosy mysteries. Some criminals were caught, some got away with their crimes and yet others found themselves with an untimely end. All the stories were clever, unpredictable and carried along at a steady pace, unlike the fast paced thrillers we are used to today, and usually had a clever twist at the end....If you enjoy stories by the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle you can't go past this intriguing anthology. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>Murder at the Manor is a collection of mystery stories. I am not the short story type person, the only exceptions being Jeffrey Archer's collections like Twelve Red Herrings or Twist in the Tale. But after reading and enjoying a bunch of reprinted old mysteries by Poisoned Pen press this year, I decided to give it a try....I think Witness for the Prosecution may be the only "short" I have read belonging to the mystery genre, that too long ago. As the name suggests here, the setting is a British classic mystery setting. And at least some mysteries must be in a manor house type situation....According to me, the problem with mysteries in a short story format is that there is not enough time or not enough words to actually establish a background. What I enjoy about classic mysteries is that the story begins slowly, we get to know the cast of characters, form our own opinions about them. then the crime is committed. Red herrings are strewn. Some investigator appears, and our preconceived ideas are either trashed or proved right. either way, we turn the pages frantically while chewing our nails. The short story does not give much opportunity for all this....One of the stories I liked was about the Druid Circle and the blood on the steps. Then there is the one where a couple of apprentices come to a shattering inference about the case they are investigating....Overall, I think this is a good book to read when you are on the go or in a hurry, when you want a slice of the mystery story but cannot be immersed in a big book. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>It has to be my colonial history that makes me nostalgic for manors, country lanes, country scenes and of course murders most prolific. This was a joy to read as it dealt with all of them and country characters as well. Lady and Lords abound, vicars and curates, butlers, maids, parlour maids, groomsmen, stable hands the lot. Downton Abbey in all its aspects combined with a hint of mystery and murder. Fabulous collection of crime. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>There is something about these dark, late autumn evenings that are perfect for a bit of old fashioned mystery and suspense. Murder at the Manor edited by Martin Edwards brings together a fabulous collection of short stories, mysteries that are set in that favourite golden age setting of the country house. As Edwards explains in his introduction, country house crime stories remain as popular as ever. Their appeal is driven particularly by nostalgia for a bygone era. The stories in this collection were written over a period of approximately sixty-five years, and cover a period in which society in Britain and life in those country houses was changing. These stories therefore cover a period before, after and naturally during that period typically referred to as the Golden Age of crime fiction. There are some real gems in this collection, with several well-known authors of these kinds of tales, including Arthur Conan Doyle, E W Hornung, G K Chesterton, Margery Allingham, Ethel Lina White and Nicholas Blake....It is always hard to review an entire collection of stories, so rather than trying to talk about each story I will endeavour to give just a flavour of this superb collection, which I just loved. Each story is prefaced with a short bio of the author, setting the story which follows in the context of the author's body of work. Several of the authors were new to me, some old friends....In this collection we are treated to a glorious mixture of mystery story ingredients, country house parties, poison, jealousy, strange inscriptions, bizarre and unexplained phenomenon, wills, suspense, jewel theft, amateur sleuths and ingenious policemen....conandoyleThere was only one story in the collection that I had read before, The Copper Beeches by Arthur Conan Doyle, which is the opening story. As a Sherlock Holmes fan, I was happy to read it again. A young woman named Violet Hunter consults Sherlock Holmes as to the wisdom in accepting a position of governess which she desperately needs, the job specifications are very odd her prospective employers requiring her dress in a certain way when asked, and to cut off her hair. Miss Hunter decides to take the position in Hampshire at a house called The Copper Beeches, but it is agreed that Holmes and Watson should be on standby in case needed. It is not long before Holmes and Watson are travelling to Hampshire to meet with Miss Hunter again, and hear the story of her peculiarly sinister employment....The Mystery of Horne's Copse by Anthony Berkeley was among my favourites (although that could be a fairly long list). As anthony berkeleyMartin Edwards explains:...The story features both Sheringham and another regular Berkeley character, Chief Inspector Moresby, and its twists and turns illustrate why Agatha Christie, among others heaped praise on the ingenuity of Berkeley mysteries....Anthony Berkeley is a writer I hadn't read before and this mystery is absolutely brilliant true I had mostly worked out what was going on, but I was desperate to know how it would all be solved. The story revolves a young man, Hugh, who had suffered from shell shock in the First World War. He is the owner of Ravendean, and his cousin Frank who is abroad with his wife, is Hugh's heir. Happily engaged to Sylvia, his future seems an assured one. Until one night, following dinner with his fianc� and friends, Hugh finds his car won't start and decides to walk through Horne's Copse. Half way through the wood, Hugh stumbles upon the body of his cousin Frank, with a bullet hole through his head. Shocked, supposing his cousin to be in Italy Hugh races off for help, the doctor and the police. On his return with the police and his friend the doctor, Frank's body is gone, and all sign that Hugh was ever there obliterated....J J Bell is another author who was new to me and his story The message on the Sun Dial is superbly executed in which he uses the plot device of the "dying message". Philip Bolsover Wingard (generally known by his middle name) is a man with debts. Bolsover is heir to his more sensible and reliable cousin Philip Merivale Wingard. When Bolsover's latest forgery of his cousin's name is discovered by his furious cousin, Bolsover is driven to take extreme action. Later that night, in the grounds of his cousin's estate a knife is drawn, and a man is murdered. Behind him is left a strange and inexplicable message on the edge of the sun dial. Can anyone fathom what it means, and solve the mystery of the attacker?...ethel lina whiteI recently read Fear Stalks the Village by Ethel Lina White, so I was looking forward to reading The Unlocked window which comes toward the end of this collection. I wasn't disappointed; it's a fantastic story of suspense, set in a country house where two nurses have care of a very sick patient. The neighbourhood have been terrified by a series of recent murders; nurses have been targeted by a medical student with a grudge....Nurse Cherry hurried through her round of fastening the windows. As she carried her candle from room to room of the upper floors, she had the uneasy feeling that she was visible to any watcher....Her mind kept wandering back to the bad business of the forgotten oxygen cylinder. It had plunged her in depths of self-distrust and shame. She was overtired, having nursed the patient single-handed, until the arrival, three days ago, of the second nurse. But that fact did not absolve her from blame. "I'm not fit to be a nurse," she told herself in bitter self-reproach....Will the unprotected women in the house fall victim to the murderer on the loose, are they really as vulnerable as Nurse Charry starts to fear? I read that whole story with my heart in my mouth. Brilliant, spine tingling stuff! I really must read more Ethel Lina White....Murder at the Manor is a superb collection most especially for fans of the Golden Age. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Another excellently curated collection from Poisoned Pen Press, this time focusing on the well-trod ground of the manor house mystery. Unsurprisingly, this group of stories often subvert the reader's expectations for this type of British cozy while at the same time satisfying the itch to solve a mystery while rich people misbehave. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>The 16 entries in this British Library crime classics anthology, most dating to the golden age of detective fiction, between the two world wars, will appeal to all lovers of English country house mysteries. Edwards opens with an unsettling Sherlock Holmes story, Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Copper Beeches," about a governess whose employers require her to perform some rather odd duties, such as cutting off her long hair. Other notable authors of the last century include E.W. Hornung, whose famed "amateur cracksman" Raffles appears in "Gentlemen and Players," and Anthony Berkeley, who shows his ingenuity in "The Mystery of Horne's Copse." Margery Allingham surprises us with "Same to Us," a short take on the country house party, and Michael Gilbert unravels a past mystery to solve a modern puzzle in "Weekend at Wapentake." Those looking for comfort on a dark and stormy night will be rewarded. (Feb.) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Here's another volume in the British Library Crime Classics series. This time the stories have been chosen because they're set in country houses, a classic mystery genre. The authors are not forgotten or neglected; the very first story in the book is Conan Doyle's The Copper Beeches, which must be very well known indeed....I particularly liked The Mystery of Horne's Copse by Anthony Berkeley, which was truly baffling. Then there's a very amusing, tongue in cheek story by E V Knox, The Murder at the Towers. Here's a flavour of it:...The gathering consisted, as the inspector had foreseen, of the usual types involved in a country house murder, namely, a frightened stepsister of the deceased, a young and beautiful niece, a major, a doctor, a chaperon, a friend, Mr. Porlock himself, an old butler with a beard, a middle-aged gardener with whiskers, an Irish cook, and two servants who had only come to the place the week before....But whenever Scotland Yard was unable to deal with a murder case&#x2015;that is to say, whenever a murder case happened at a country house&#x2015;Bletherby Marge was called in....Bletherby Marge, indeed!...For me, the most frightening story is An Unlocked Window. It's by that interesting writer Ethel Lina White, author of The Wheel Spins, which Alfred Hitchcock filmed as The Lady Vanishes. Two nurses alone with their patient in an isolated house, with a murderer on the loose, an atmosphere of fear and terror and a great twist....I read this courtesy of NetGalley and enjoyed it very much.

More advanced topics range from integrating barnyard birds into a garden to getting more mileage out of the home water cycle to the benefits of a balanced insect population. The illustrations are amusing as well as helpful, and though the index is not extensive, the book, overall, is a much better read than the average gardening book, both in terms of range and entertainment value." - <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> Online, December 2006 <p>"For activist readers who believe activism is a political pursuit, <i>FOOD NOT LAWNS: HOW TO TURN YOUR YARD INTO A GARDEN AND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD INTO A COMMUNITY</i> offers a different viewpoint, maintaining that growing food where you live is a key method of becoming a food activist in the community. Chapters advocate planting home and community gardens with an eye to drawing important connections between the politics of a home or community garden and the wider politics of usage, consumption, and sustainability. Another rarity: chapters promote small, easy changes in lifestyles to achieve a transition between personal choice and political activism at the community level, providing keys to change any reader can use." - Bookwatch/Midwest Book Review, December 2006 </p><p>"Certified permaculture designer Flores advocates living an ecologically friendly lifestyle by creating gardens. Following a foreword by Toby Hemenway (<i>Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture</i>), she discusses the identification of garden sites, the water cycle and water conservation, soils and composting, plants, how to save seed, project design, the fostering of community involvement, the inclusion of children in projects, the sharing of information, and activism. Many of Flores's ideas are for the extremely committed. She advocates dumpster digging, composting human feces, and living life without appliances like refrigerators. She also suggests growing food on land, not necessarily with the landowner's permission, and espouses gray-water conservation techniques that may be illegal in some communities. While growing your own food is a worthy goal, Flores doesn't always seem to recognize the hard work involved. She also doesn't expand on all of her ideas, but she does offer an extensive list of resources for further research. Flores has an engaging style and is clearly passionate about her subject, and her debut book provides an alternative viewpoint, but it will probably not interest mainstream audiences.

Homeless and jobless, she is&nbsp;the mother of a toddler by a man whose name she didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;quite catch, and her once pretty face is disfigured by the&nbsp;scar she acquired in a car accident. Friendless and without&nbsp;family, she&#x2019;s recently disentangled herself from a selfish&nbsp;and indifferent boyfriend and a cruel and indifferent&nbsp;mother. But she shares a quality common to Barbara&nbsp;Comyns&#x2019;s other heroines: a bracingly unsentimental ability&nbsp;to carry on. Before too long, Bella has found not only a&nbsp;job but a vocation; not only a place to live but a home and&nbsp;a makeshift family. As Comyns&#x2019;s novel progresses, the&nbsp;story echoes and inverts the Brothers Grimm&#x2019;s macabre&nbsp;tale <i>The Juniper Tree</i>. Will Bella&#x2019;s hard-won restoration to&nbsp;life and love come at the cost of the happiness of others?</p><p><b>Barbara Comyns&nbsp;</b>(1909&#x2013;1992) was born in Bidfordon-Avon, in the English county of Warwickshire, one of six children of an increasingly unsuccessful Birmingham brewer. Living on the run-down but romantic family estate and receiving her education from governesses, she began to write and illustrate stories at the age of ten. After her father&#x2019;s death, she attended art school in London and married a painter, with whom she had two children she supported by trading antiques and classic cars, modeling, breeding poodles, and renovating apartments. A second marriage, to Richard Comyns Carr, who worked in the Foreign Office, took place during World War II. Comyns wrote her first book, <i>Sisters by a River</i> (1947), a series of sketches based on her childhood, while living in the country to escape the Blitz, which is also when she made an initial sketch for <i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i> (1959). This, however, she put aside to complete <i>Our Spoons Came from Woolworths</i> (1950) and <i>Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead</i> (1954). <i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i> was published in 1959. Among Comyns&#x2019;s other books are the novels <i>The Skin Chairs</i> (1962) and <i>The Juniper Tree </i>(1985), and <i>Out of the Red into the Blue</i> (1960), a work of nonfiction about Spain, where she lived for eighteen years.<br><br><b> Sadie Stein&nbsp;</b>is a writer and critic living in New York."A treasure from the 1980s...[<i>The Juniper Tree</i>] picks up the Grimm notion that an excess of maternal happiness can prove fatal...Comyns's prose is vivid and charmingly hurried... The Grimm story is about evil, revenge, and justice&#x2014;an eye for an eye&#x2014;but <i>The Juniper Tree</i> is about accidents, damage, and repair." &#x2014;Christine Smallwood, <i>Harper's<br></i><br>&#x201c;The novel . . . achieves a life of its own, and allows Bella to emerge at last from her ordeal with a feminist, fertile, happy, fairy-tale ending. Hypnotic and enthralling in the process.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> &#x201c;Comyns&#x2019;s world is weird and wonderful . . . there&#x2019;s also something uniquely original about her voice. Tragic, comic and completely bonkers all in one, I&#x2019;d go as far as to call her something of a neglected genius.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Lucy Scholes,<i> The Observer</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Juniper Tree</i>, which appeared in 1985, is one of Comyns&#x2019;s most successful, confident and curious productions. It has the clear pure narrative quality of a fable, but also shows a humanity and maturity.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Margaret Drabble<br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Juniper Tree</i> is a fairy tale that haunts me because even at the end the evil in it is never wholly undone. Through her reimagining of the wicked stepmother figure, Comyns speculates convincingly as to how damage escalates despite all conscious attempts to limit itself.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Helen Oyeyemi<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there is any other novelist I&#x2019;ve come across who writes so subtly the disturbing and the domestic.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Stuck in a Book </i>(blog)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Comyns approaches the world as if everything is worthy of clear-eyed attention. In this novel in particular, she is better than any other writer I know at striking an impossible balance between accuracy, wonder, and disgust.&#x201d; &#x2014;Brian Evenson, <i>The Rumpus</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Comyn&#x2019;s [CE1]&nbsp;voice has childlike qualities; she looks at everything in the world as though seeing it for the first time. In later books, though, her narrators&#x2019; naivety is deployed in order to provoke horror; the gap between what the reader knows and the narrator doesn&#x2019;t serves to make the reader fascinated and fearful.&#x201d; &#x2014;Emily Gould, <i>The Awl</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here is a beautifully organized, well-written book that reads almost conversationally.... Delicate, tough, quick moving, it&#x2019;s a haunting book...an amazing achievement...&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Comyns&#x2019;s heroines, and her novels, are plaintive, strange, and robust all at once.... As an exercise in reconstruction, using the old ingredients but producing a fable for a different age, <i>The Juniper Tree </i>could hardly have been more satisfactorily accomplished.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times</i> <i>Literary Supplement</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hypnotic and enthralling.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><h2>After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for a Secular Age</h2><p><b>A renowned Buddhist teacher&#x2019;s magnum opus, based on his fresh reading of the tradition&#x2019;s earliest texts</b><br><br> Some twenty-five centuries after the Buddha started teaching, his message continues to inspire people across the globe, including those living in predominantly secular societies. What does it mean to adapt religious practices to secular contexts?<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephen Batchelor, an internationally known author and teacher, is committed to a secularized version of the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings. The time has come, he feels, to articulate a coherent ethical, contemplative, and philosophical vision of Buddhism for our age. <i>After Buddhism,</i> the culmination of four decades of study and practice in the Tibetan, Zen, and Theravada traditions, is his attempt to set the record straight about who the Buddha was and what he was trying to teach. Combining critical readings of the earliest canonical texts with narrative accounts of five members of the Buddha&#x2019;s inner circle, Batchelor depicts the Buddha as a pragmatic ethicist rather than a dogmatic metaphysician. He envisions Buddhism as a constantly evolving culture of awakening whose long survival is due to its capacity to reinvent itself and interact creatively with each society it encounters.<br> &nbsp;<br> This original and provocative book presents a new framework for understanding the remarkable spread of Buddhism in today&#x2019;s globalized world. It also reminds us of what was so startling about the Buddha&#x2019;s vision of human flourishing.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>What are you trying to achieve in this book?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>After Buddhism</i> is the culmination of forty years of thinking about and practicing the dharma as a modern Westerner. I pull together a number of threads that I have explored in earlier writings, such as <i>Buddhism without Beliefs.</i> In all of my writings I address the question of how the teachings of this ancient Asian religion might speak to the condition of our secular age. This new work is an attempt to recover what was truly original about the Buddha's vision and to acquire a better understanding of the man himself. Recent scholarship affords us both a clearer picture of the historical world in which Gotama lived and more critical insight into the earliest discourses. Together, these allow the possibility of rethinking the dharma from the ground up.<br> &nbsp;<br> Who have you written this book for?<br> &nbsp;<br> With the widespread adoption of mindfulness, more and more people find themselves practicing a form of meditation that is rooted in the Buddhist tradition. I hope this book might do for Buddhist ethics and philosophy what the mindfulness movement has done for Buddhist meditation: provide a framework of values and ideas that have been stripped of their religious and metaphysical associations to reveal a practical way of life that is available to all&#x2014;which might help us deal with some of the urgent questions we face as a human community in the twenty-first century.An internationally known author, teacher, and scholar of Buddhism, <b>Stephen Batchelor</b> leads secular Buddhist retreats worldwide, is a founding member of the Bodhi College, and a contributing editor of <i>Tricycle: The Buddhist Review</i><i>.</i> He lives in southwest France.</p><h2>Crime and Punishment (Oxford World&#39;s Classics Hardback Collection)</h2><p><strong>"One death, in exchange for thousands of lives - it's simple arithmetic!"</strong><br><br>A new translation of Dostoevsky's epic masterpiece, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1866). The impoverished student Raskolnikov decides to free himself from debt by killing an old moneylender, an act he sees as elevating himself above conventional morality. Like Napoleon he will assert his will and his crime will be justified by its elimination of "vermin" for the sake of the greater good. But Raskolnikov is torn apart by fear, guilt, and a growing conscience under the influence of his love for Sonya. Meanwhile the police detective Porfiry is on his trail. It is a powerfully psychological novel, in which the St Petersburg setting, Dostoevsky's own circumstances, and contemporary social problems all play their part.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nicolas Pasternak Slater</strong> has translated several works by Boris Pasternak, most recently <em>The Family Correspondence, 1921-1960</em> (Hoover Press, 2010).

Such costumes from all regions of the world are represented here in 500 full-color photographs of individuals and groups. Considering the scope, treatment is necessarily brief but does include fascinating facts about the background, traditions, and evolution of the garments as well as design, materials, and decorations. The result is a kaleidoscope of exotic hues and embellishments. Maps identify each geographic region, and a two-page glossary is added.

Baker, Western Kentucky Univ. Libs., Bowling Green<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Though not a definitive guide to folk dress from aborigines to Zulus, Kennett's book is a stimulating one, thanks to its streamlined text and beautiful, brightly colored photographs of ethnic costume. Here in one place we find North American Inuits garbed in fur head to toe, learn that male apparel worldwide tends toward white, and that Chechens and Cossacks traditionally don tall fur hats, a custom that unfortunately may disappear in the current wars. The sparse prose covers basic symbols, traditions, and colors, with a nod to today's variations; at the end of each chapter are an illustrated map and a potpourri of close-up shots, showing specific items of apparel. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Philosophy: The Quest For Truth</h2><p>Praised for its unique combination of accessibility and comprehensiveness, <em>Philosophy: The Quest for Truth</em> provides an excellent selection of ninety-one classical and contemporary readings--on nineteen key problems in philosophy--carefully organized so that they present pro/con dialogues that allow students to compare and contrast the philosophers' positions.

Fans of the 1992 book Diana used to bash her in-laws--Andrew Morton's <i>Diana: Her True Story</i>--and Prince Charles's 1995 riposte--Jonathan Dimbleby's <i>The Prince of Wales</i>--will detect much familiar material. So will anyone who's ever read a newspaper. Even so, Kelley has a great eye for the salable quote and anecdote, and her book makes for handy one-stop gossip shopping.<p> Here are a few of the nasty allegations Kelley collects in a history of Britain's top dogs: though the royals may love their corgis more than their children and spouses, they pinch the poor pooches' posteriors to make them bark into the phone to amuse the royals at the other end of the line. Also, the Queen Mother may have been born out of wedlock, and her daughter, Queen Elizabeth, may have been conceived by artificial insemination.</p><p> There are dozens of other stinky zingers in Kelley's book, mostly from anonymous sources. The late Princess Diana comes off the best, even though Kelley suggests that she may have shoved her 58-year-old stepmother down the stairs. Diana met her last lover, Dodi, after <i>The Royals</i> went to press, so there's nothing in it about them--though Kelley does relate previous 100 m.p.h. chases and press encounters ending in gore. It was a long, sad story leading up to the last crash, and Kelley tells the family's worst enemies' account of it in a tone colder than the royals themselves.</p>They are the most chronicled family on the face of the globe. Their every move attracts headlines. Scores of books have tried and failed to penetrate the royal facade. Now Kitty Kelley, bestselling author of <i>Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography</i> and <i>His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra</i>, has gone behind palace walls to provide the first three-dimensional, comprehensive, and even-handed portrait of the men and women who make up the British royal family.<p> Kelley, the most fearless biographer of our time, spent more than four years investigating the royal family. In addition to meticulous research into documented sources, she conducted hundreds of exclusive interviews with past and present employees of the royal household, royal friends and relations, courtiers, members of Parliament, and other intimate observers. The author has unveiled and examined the private lives of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Prince Andrew, and Sarah, the Duchess of York, as well as their forebears and predecessors, as no other biographer has been able to do.</p><p> Kitty Kelley has raised the curtain on this most secretive family. Here are lonely royal children brought up without a proper education in isolated and artificial surroundings, twentieth-century adolescents with nineteenth-century touchstones. Here are the sexual ambiguities, the alcoholism, gambling, and womanizing that were common in the House of Windsor long before Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer. No one is spared; here are the scandals of the last decades: the doomed marriages and the husbands, wives, lovers and children caught in their wake and damaged beyond repair.</p><p> Illuminating the Windsors' arrogance, naivete, and lusts as well as hard work, dedication, and the ability to survive the most humiliating disclosures, <i>The Royals</i> is Kitty Kelley's richest, most iconoclastic, historically significant, and compelling book. She smashes the images created by palace bureaucrats and perpetuated by our own fantasies. Yet she introduced readers to people they can understand and will never forget.</p></p><h2>Learn-A-Language Books Spanish, Grade 1</h2><p>This new series uses a simple approach to help kids master the basics of the Spanish language including sentence structure, vocabulary, pronunciation, and verbs.

After studying painting with Giorgio de Chirico and Fernand L�ger in Paris, she returned to her native city&#x2014;she would live there for the rest of her life&#x2014;and devoted herself to writing. Her eldest sister, Victoria, was the founder of the seminal modernist journal and publishing house Sur, which championed the work of Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, and in 1940 Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo were married. The first of Ocampo&#x2019;s seven collections of stories, <i>Viaje olvidado</i> (Forgotten Journey), appeared in 1937; the first of her seven volumes of poems, <i>Enumeraci�n de la patria</i> (Enumeration of My Country) in 1942.&nbsp; She was also a prolific translator &#x2014;of Dickinson, Poe, Melville, and Swedenborg&#x2014;and wrote plays and tales for children.

Over one of their legendary conversations, the three friends came upon the idea of editing the <i>Antolog�a de la Literatura Fant�stica</i>, which was published in 1940.<p>"These stories are feverish, cruel, and wry, set among the surrealisms of puberty, disability, and precarity." &#x2014;Joshua Cohen, <i>Harper's</i></p><p>&#x201c;She lived a&nbsp;little in the shadow of her sister Victoria on the one hand and of her husband&nbsp;Bioy&nbsp;Casares and Borges on the other.

It rapidly became the standard work of reference for the correct use of English in terms of choice of words, grammar, and style. Much loved for his firm opinions, passion, and dry humor, Fowler has stood the test of time and is still considered by many to be the best arbiter of good practice.<br> Now Oxford is bringing back the original long-out-of-print first edition of this beloved work, enhanced with a new introduction by one of today's leading experts on the language, David Crystal. Drawing on a wealth of entertaining examples, Crystal offers an insightful reassessment Fowler's reputation and his place in the history of linguistic thought. Fowler, Crystal points out, was far more sophisticated in his analysis of language than most people realize and many of his entries display a concern for descriptive accuracy which would do any modern linguist proud. And although the book is full of his personal likes and dislikes, Fowler's prescriptivism is usually intelligent and reasoned. Crystal concludes warmly that Fowler was like "an endearingly eccentric, schoolmasterly character, driven at times to exasperation by the infelicities of his wayward pupils, but always wanting the best for them and hoping to provide the best guidance for them.... He may shake his stick at us, but we never feel we are actually going to be beaten."<br> In the concluding section of the book, Crystal examines nearly 300 entries in detail, offers a modern perspective on them, and shows how English has changed since the 1920s. This exciting and long awaited re-release of one of the classic works of English reference will delight everyone interested in language.</p><p><br>David Crystal is honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Bangor, and the author of many books on language in general and the English language in particular, such as <em>The Stories of English</em> (2004), <em>The Fight for English</em> (2006), and <em>Think on My Words: Exploring Shakespeare's Language</em> (2008).

New York Times Book Review</p><h2>From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America</h2><p><p>In the United States today, one in every thirty-one adults is under some form of penal control, including one in eleven African American men. How did the &#x201c;land of the free&#x201d; become the home of the world&#x2019;s largest prison system? Challenging the belief that America&#x2019;s prison problem originated with the Reagan administration&#x2019;s War on Drugs, Elizabeth Hinton traces the rise of mass incarceration to an ironic source: the social welfare programs of Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s Great Society at the height of the civil rights era.</p><p>Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty policies sought to foster equality and economic opportunity. But these initiatives were also rooted in widely shared assumptions about African Americans&#x2019; role in urban disorder, which prompted Johnson to call for a simultaneous War on Crime. The 1965 Law Enforcement Assistance Act empowered the national government to take a direct role in militarizing local police. Federal anticrime funding soon incentivized social service providers to ally with police departments, courts, and prisons. Under Richard Nixon and his successors, welfare programs fell by the wayside while investment in policing and punishment expanded. Anticipating future crime, policymakers urged states to build new prisons and introduced law enforcement measures into urban schools and public housing, turning neighborhoods into targets of police surveillance.</p><p>By the 1980s, crime control and incarceration dominated national responses to poverty and inequality. The initiatives of that decade were less a sharp departure than the full realization of the punitive transformation of urban policy implemented by Republicans and Democrats alike since the 1960s.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Hinton is Assistant Professor of History and African and African American Studies at Harvard University.Readers will appreciate Hinton&#x2019;s archival deep dive into the various and successive congressional acts responsible, sometimes unwittingly, sometimes not, for what amounts in her terms to criminalizing poverty. She discusses the prevailing social science theories that informed those laws...and frequently cites official reports and informal intergovernmental communications that expose the policymakers&#x2019; thinking. General readers will be appalled at her portrayal of outrageous police practices. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>An outstanding book&#x2015;clear, compelling, and essential. Hinton excavates the deep roots of police militarization, surveillance of minority communities, and the punitive shift in urban policy. Her argument that liberals were key architects of the war on crime is a necessary and even urgent corrective to conventional thinking about mass incarceration. (Matthew Lassiter, author of <i>The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South</i>)<br><br><p>A superb work that is a major and timely contribution to the history of mass incarceration. It powerfully resets and sharpens the debate among scholars on the interaction of federal and state dynamics in shaping the modern carceral state.</p> (Jonathan Simon, author of <i>Mass Incarceration on Trial: A Remarkable Court Decision and the Future of Prisons in America</i>)<br><br>A clear-eyed and timely book, it traces the country&#x2019;s cannibalistic prison industrial complex back to the social welfare programs created by Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty. This history is heartbreaking, but it is one that affects an enormous percentage of the country...Read it and vote&#x2015;especially for the state legislators, judges, and district attorneys who exert the greatest influence over the system. (Molly McArdle <i>Brooklyn Magazine</i>)<br><br>Magisterial. (Steven W. Thrasher <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>At a moment when policing&#x2019;s impact on African Americans and mass incarceration have again become topic of national conversation, Hinton&#x2019;s book is significant for its reminder that both liberals and conservatives share the blame. (Jeff Guo <i>Washington Post blog</i>)<br><br><i>From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime</i> requires slow and careful reading for anyone seeking to grasp the full implications of this exceedingly well-researched work...The book is vivid with detail and sharp analysis...Hinton&#x2019;s book is more than an argument; it is a revelation...There are moments that will make your skin crawl...This is history, but the implications for today are striking. Readers will learn how the militarization of the police that we&#x2019;ve witnessed in Ferguson and elsewhere had roots in the 1960s...A reader cannot help reckoning with the truth that the problem of police brutality and mass incarceration won&#x2019;t be remedied with technology and training. Those of us who believe in the principles of democracy and justice would do well to witness, as detailed in Hinton&#x2019;s pages, the shameful theft of liberty in this so-called land of the free. (Imani Perry <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>An extraordinary and important new book. (Jill Lepore <i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>Hinton&#x2019;s well-researched book is filled with historical anecdotes painting a colorful picture of the nation&#x2019;s persistent struggle with crime since President Johnson coined the phrase &#x2018;War on Crime&#x2019; more than fifty years ago...<i>From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime</i> is smart, engaging, and well-argued. (Lauren-Brooke Eisen <i>National Review</i>)<br><br>Hinton&#x2019;s book constitutes the most comprehensive analysis of the historical roots of mass incarceration to date. Those wanting to deepen the understanding of this history that they may have gained from <i>The New Jim Crow</i>, the <i>Golden Gulag</i> and <i>The First Civil Right</i> would do well to seriously engage this wonderful work.

Recent research has revealed dark surprises and yielded a radically new scenario of how AIDS began and spread. Excerpted and adapted from the book <em>Spillover</em>, with a new introduction by the author, Quammen's hair-raising investigation tracks the virus from chimp populations in the jungles of southeastern Cameroon to laboratories across the globe, as he unravels the mysteries of when, where, and under what circumstances such a consequential "spillover" can happen. An audacious search for answers amid more than a century of data, <em>The Chimp and the River</em> tells the haunting tale of one of the most devastating pandemics of our time.</p></p><p>David Quammen is the author of The Song of the Dodo, among other books. He has been honored with the John Burroughs Medal for nature writing, an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an award in the art of the essay from PEN, and (three times) the National Magazine Award.

Through popular culture, current events, history and personal life stories, the essays analyze the forces that hold the white race together--and those that promise to tear it apart. When a critical mass of people come together who, though they look white, have ceased to act white, the white race will undergo fission and former whites will be able to take part in building a new human community.</p><p>The journal <i>Race Traitor</i> began in 1992 with one lofty ambition: "to serve as an intellectual center for those seeking to abolish the white race." The editors define the white race as a historically constructed social group consisting of all those who benefit from having white skin and are thus empowered by the status quo. They see the concept of whiteness as a barrier to justice and equality, insisting that deeply ingrained social problems cannot be solved until the privileges of white skin are abolished. Since they define the white race as a historical rather than a natural classification, it follows that this system can be undone--but only if a noticeable segment of whites are willing to dismiss conformity to their color. "Treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity," the editors declare. The enemies of social progress, then, are not just white supremacists but anyone unwilling to dismiss the benefits conferred by racial status.<p> This anthology contains essays from the first five editions of <i>Race Traitor</i>, and its contributors are a varied lot: professors, poets, activists, skinheads, and prison inmates all toss their opinions into the racial ring. The essays range from sociological examinations of "whiteness" to examples of rampant racism and individuals' attempts to stand up to it. Though the book's introduction states that "<i>Race Traitor</i> exists not to make converts," the arguments presented in this collection have the power and grace to do just that. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><strong>Noel Ignatiev</strong> is the author of <em>How the Irish Became White</em> (Routledge, 1995). <strong>John Garvey</strong> works in the Office of Academic Affairs at City University of New York.

With its publication, a giant world of literature has just grown twice as tall."--<i>Newsday</i><br><br>From Ralph Ellison--author of the classic novel of African-American experience, <b>Invisible Man</b>--the long-awaited second novel. Here is the master of American vernacular--the rhythms of jazz and gospel and ordinary speech--at the height of his powers, telling a powerful, evocative tale of a prodigal of the twentieth century. <br><br>"Tell me what happened while there's still time," demands the dying Senator Adam Sunraider to the itinerate Negro preacher whom he calls Daddy Hickman. As a young man, Sunraider was Bliss, an orphan taken in by Hickman and raised to be a preacher like himself. Bliss's history encompasses the joys of young southern boyhood; bucolic days as a filmmaker, lovemaking in a field in the Oklahoma sun. And behind it all lies a mystery: how did this chosen child become the man who would deny everything to achieve his goals? Brilliantly crafted, moving, wise, <b>Juneteenth</b> is the work of an American master.</p><p><i>Invisible Man</i>, which Ralph Ellison published in 1952, was one of the great debuts in contemporary literature. Alternating phantasmagoria with rock-ribbed realism, it delved into the blackest (and whitest!) corners of the American psyche, and quickly attained the status of legend. Ellison's follow-up, however, seemed truly bedeviled--not only by its monumental predecessor, but by fate itself. First, a large section of the novel went up in flames when the author's house burned in 1967. Then he spent decades reconstructing, revising, and expanding his initial vision. When Ellison died in 1994, he left behind some 2,000 pages of manuscript. Yet this mythical mountain of prose was clearly unfinished, far too sketchy and disjointed to publish. Apparently Ellison's second novel would never appear. <p> Or would it? Ellison's literary executor, John Callahan, has now quarried a smaller, more coherent work from all that raw material. Gone are the epic proportions that Ellison so clearly envisioned. Instead, <i>Juneteenth</i> revolves around just two characters: Adam Sunraider, a white, race-baiting New England senator, and Alonzo "Daddy" Hickman, a black Baptist minister who turns out to have a paradoxical (and paternal) relationship to his opposite number. As the book opens, Sunraider is delivering a typically bigoted peroration on the Senate floor when he's peppered by an assassin's bullets. Mortally wounded, he summons the elderly Hickman to his bedside. There the two commence a journey into their shared past, which (unlike the rest of 1950s America) represents a true model of racial integration. </p><p> Adam, we discover, was born Bliss, and raised by Hickman in the bosom of the black community. What's more, this rabble-rouser was being groomed as a boy minister. ("I tell you, Bliss," says Hickman, "you're going to make a fine preacher and you're starting at just the right age. You're just a little over six and Jesus Christ himself didn't start until he was twelve.") The portion of <i>Juneteenth</i> that covers Bliss's ecclesiastical education--perhaps a third of the entire book--is as electrifying as anything in <i>Invisible Man</i>. Ellison juggles the multiple ironies of race and religion with effortless brilliance, and his delight in Hickman's house-wrecking rhetoric is contagious: </p><blockquote> Bliss, I've heard you cutting some fancy didoes on the radio, but son, Eatmore was romping and rampaging and walking through Jerusalem just like John! Oh, but wasn't he romping! Maybe you were too young to get it all, but that night that mister was ten thousand misters and his voice was pure gold. </blockquote> In comparison, though, the rest of the novel seems like pretty slim pickings. For one thing, much of the plot--including Bliss's transformation from pint-sized preacher to United States senator--is absent. For another, Ellison's confinement of the two top-billed players to a hospital room makes for an awfully static narrative. Granted, he intended their dialogue to exist "on a borderline between the folk poetry and religious rhetoric" (or so he wrote in his notes). But this is a dicey recipe for a novel, and <i>Juneteenth</i> veers between naturalism and hallucination much less effectively than its predecessor did. <p> None of this is to assail Ellison's artistry, which remains on ample display. The problem is that Callahan's splice job--which well may be the best one possible--remains weak at the seams. So should readers give <i>Juneteenth</i> a miss? The answer would still have to be no. The best parts are as powerful and necessary as anything in our literature, evoking Daddy Hickman's own brand of verbal enchantment. "I was talking like I always talk," he recalls at one point, "in the same old down-home voice, that is, in the beloved idiom... [and] I preached those five thousand folks into silence." Ellison, too, is capable of preaching the reader into silence--and that's not something we can afford to overlook. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Ralph Ellison Reflects on Winning the National Book Award<p>For me the most important single affect attending my winning of the National Book Award was the feeling of affirmation which came with the news that a committee or respected writers had considered my novel worthy of a major literary prize. Despite my having received a good press during the months before the award, and although sales were moving much better than I had dared hope, these were by no means reliable indicators as to the degree of the only type of success which had really concerned me. The anticipated relief of having published a novel turned to frustration. I puzzled as to whether the book was being well received because it possessed recognizable literary quality, or if were for other, non-literary reasons. I was uncomfortably aware that some of my most favorable reviews were �good� for startlingly wrong reasons, and I knew only too well that poor novels too often out-sell quite superior ones. Thus I was like a traveler who after a long and difficult journey arrives at the promised land�only to discover that here his eyes no longer focus correctly and that his ears distort all sounds. In short, a land pleasant but decidedly ambiguous.</p><p>I had indeed just emerged from an obscurity in which I had worked for five years undisturbed by thoughts of future sales or reviewers notices, and in which the possibility of winning prizes was utterly undreamed. My sold preoccupation had been with transforming a body of seemingly intractable material into a work of art. Thus, while the sudden publicity was quite heady and the sales most welcome, my true sense of fulfillment came only when this committee concerned precisely with literary quality had, through its choice of my novel, justified all of the time, the sacrifices and the aspiration which had gone into it. Even now, long after the post-award publicity had faded, and with the money from the increased sales long spent, it is their act of recognition which continues with me. It is this which gives me certain comfort today as I feel my way slowly toward the completion of what will surely be regarded a rather arrogantly ambitious novel. I hope, by the way, that no one will blame this on the fateful committee.</p><p>You ask whether the award has affected my status as a writer, to which I must reply that the question has never occurred to me. I will say however, that where Negroes are concerned, all questions of status are likely to be reduced to, and confused with, questions of racial and social status. One has long been intertwined with the other and it has seemed to me a mistake for a writer to worry about them�certainly in any effort at self-evaluation. Much better to spend the time trying to learn one�s craft. Lest however, this seems an attempt at evasion, let me go on to say that I did not regard it as especially significant that a Negro should win the NBA, but I was please, nevertheless, that the conditions of the award make it mandatory that even a novel, which happens to be written by a Negro must be subjected to as rigid and as �objective��and as non-racial�a scrutiny, say, as that now commonly faced by major league baseball players who also happen to be Negroes. The trick here is that of creating one�s own identity through the medium of one�s chosen art; not that of having it thrust upon one as an act of racial policy, or as a gesture of liberal sentiment. One wishes only to compete freely and with no special considerations pro or contra. I had won prizes in the form of scholarships and fellowships before, but the NBA was the first (though not the last) not hedged by considerations of race. This is an extra-literary consideration but one of significance for many of my people, and one which has affected both their evaluation of me and their sense of what is possible in the world of publishing; make of it what you will.</p><p>Which reminds me that where it was once considered an honor simply to be the first Negro to win recognition in a given field, it has now become something of an embarrassment; it creates an uncertainty as to whether one has compete successfully or simply been the recipient of parternalistic encouragement. This is no complaint, mind you; I find it most amusing. Besides, uncertainty of this order is precisely the one condition of freedom which cannot be done away with. Is this the price of being a free man and an artist? Very well, I�ll gladly whirl and quiver in such an atmosphere of uncertainty until I resemble the neddles on the instruments of some space-bound missile.</p><p>While I can say nothing definite concerning the affect of the award upon my status as a writer, I can say that although it has not increased my rate of production, the excitement generated by its yearly ceremony has helped to keep my identity fresh in the minds of many reviewers and readers. This is no small advantage for one who writes as slowly as I. It has also been called to my attention that INVISIBLE MAN has been discussed in several recent books of criticism, both here and abroad, and I�m told further that it is being discussed in various college courses�one of them a class in abnormal psychology. I can�t say whether the concern here is with my own psychology or that of my hero, some people insist upon confusing the two. Nor can I say how much of the attention is due to the award for I am aware that some of the oritics had dealt with the book quite seriously before the great event.</p><p>As for certain disadvantages which go with the award, I found them intertwined, as always, with the advantages. I can say definitely that winning the award made for an intense focus of attention in terms of publicity, radio and television appearances, lecture engagements and interviews. These in turn brought various crackpots to my door and various looks screws to my telephone�some of them quite entertaining. It also made for many new acquaintances and for an increase of social invitations; which in turn made it necessary that my wife and I try to reciprocate. Indeed, a good part of the increased royalties from the award went for this purpose, which made it no less enjoyable; though I still feel defeated over that fact that after avoiding it successfully for years I had finally to purchase a dinner jacket.</p><p>Perhaps the most critical thing I have to say of the award is that the wave of publicity which goes with it is apt to leave one exhausted if one rides it for too long a time. It makes for interruptions and losses to time (as with these paragraphs in which I'� trying to discuss matter about which I�m much too subjective�and uninterested�to be at all competent). True, such loss of time can be spent in most charming ways of course and it is up to the individual writer to determine when to break away and seek again his own obscurity. In my own case I gave myself freely to the experience of being swept along by what surely is one of our most amusing cultural phenomena, by which I mean our publicity industry, the so-called big media, which very often can make truly big men seem small, but which can also give obscure little men such as I a taste of fame. In spite of the wear and tear which I sustained, the glimpse which it provided me into an important area of our national life might well prove as important as the sense of affirmation which came with the award. Without doubt, it provided me a new context of experience, something which is not too easy to come by after a writer has passed his twenties. In this connection, let me say that one unquestioned affect of the award for which I am most grateful, is it�s bringing my wife and I to the attention of certain men and women of great gifts and accomplishments, thus leading to several creative associations. And, in a few precious instances, to friendships that have enlivened and enriched our lives in ways too numerous to describe. I hope it isn�t necessary to state here that I am most proud to be numbered among those who have won the award. </p><p>Courtesy of The National Book Foundation</p></p><h2>How Finance Works: The HBR Guide to Thinking Smart About the Numbers</h2><p><b>Based on a popular class taught by a Harvard Business School professor.</b><p>If you're not a numbers person, then finance can be intimidating and easy to ignore.

Was there really a forced exile in the first century, at the hands of the Romans? Should we regard the Jewish people, throughout two millennia, as both a distinct ethnic group and a putative nation&#x2014;returned at last to its Biblical homeland?<br><br>Shlomo Sand argues that most Jews actually descend from converts, whose native lands were scattered far across the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The formation of a Jewish people and then a Jewish nation out of these disparate groups could only take place under the sway of a new historiography, developing in response to the rise of nationalism throughout Europe. Beneath the biblical back fill of the nineteenth-century historians, and the twentieth-century intellectuals who replaced rabbis as the architects of Jewish identity, <i>The Invention of the Jewish People</i> uncovers a new narrative of Israel&#x2019;s formation, and proposes a bold analysis of nationalism that accounts for the old myths.<br><br>After a long stay on Israel&#x2019;s bestseller list, and winning the coveted Aujourd&#x2019;hui Award in France, <i>The Invention of the Jewish People</i> is finally available in English. The central importance of the conflict in the Middle East ensures that Sand&#x2019;s arguments will reverberate well beyond the historians and politicians that he takes to task. Without an adequate understanding of Israel&#x2019;s past, capable of superseding today&#x2019;s opposing views, diplomatic solutions are likely to remain elusive. In this iconoclastic work of history, Shlomo Sand provides the intellectual foundations for a new vision of Israel&#x2019;s future.</p><p><b>Shlomo Sand</b> studied history at the University of Tel Aviv and at the �cole des hautes �tudes en sciences sociales, in Paris. He currently teaches contemporary history at the University of Tel Aviv.

Every Israeli schoolchild is taught that this happened during the period of the Roman rile, in 70 CE. The nation remained loyal to its land, to which it began to return after two millennia of exile. Wrong, says the historian Shlomo Sand, in one of the most fascinating and challenging books published here in a long time.

This book offers many practical ideas on how to do that." <br> &#x2014; George M. C. Fisher, former chairman and CEO, Eastman Kodak Company <p> "Most consulting is practiced in ways that are doomed to failure. If you use expert advisers, whether from your staff or from a consulting firm, this book provides plenty of insight on how you can increase the odds of a high payback." <br> &#x2014; Lawrence J. Toole, former senior vice president and manager, human resources, GE Capital </p><p> "The allure of using consultants for tough business problems is fraught with risk. As Bob Schaffer explains, the relationships between business managers and consultants frequently end in disappointment. High-Impact Consulting should be read by all managers about to use a consultant, and by those consultants who want results as well as fees." <br> &#x2014; John H. Biggs, chairman and CEO, TIAA-CREF </p><p> "Effective consultants, whether external or on company staff, must sell and deliver significant and measurable results. Too often what is delivered is just advice and activity. Bob Schaffer tells client executives how to demand stretch results and teaches consultants how to change their practice to deliver them. His approach works." <br> &#x2014; C. Richard Larrick, manager, mill improvement process, Georgia-Pacific Corporation; former president, Paper Industry Management Association </p><p></p>Even though corporate clients continue to spend millions of dollars on consultant-based solutions, the success rate of these high-priced remedies is far from what it should be. No matter how wise and creative the input of a consultant, says Robert H. Schaffer, it will pay off only if the client does what is necessary to benefit from the advice. But often there's a big "implementation gap" between what client's must do to make a project succeed and what they are actually able and willing to do. <br> In this new and revised edition of the landmark book <i>High-Impact Consulting</i>, Robert H. Schaffer reveals how senior managers unwittingly collude with their consultants to perpetuate the great waste inherent in "the five fatal flaws of conventional consulting." Drawing on his own work with companies&#x2014; Motorola, Rio Tinto, IBM, General Reinsurance Corporation, The World Bank, and other successful organizations&#x2014; Schaffer offers a field-tested approach to working with consultants that has proven to get results. He identifies the key elements of an effective project design�particularly that project objectives are defined in terms of client results rather than just consultant deliverables. The process enables clients to be certain that the work is carried out in ways that ensure success. <br> The author explains the importance of accomplishing results quickly and then using these "rapid-cycle wins" as vehicles for sharpening management skills, strengthening work disciplines, and introducing new technology. In addition he tells managers and consultants how they can build on these early successes and tackle larger accomplishments and organization wide improvements. <br> This thoroughly updated edition features valuable new insights and illustrative cases. It also includes a wealth of practical new tools that make the book a user-friendly, quick reference for both client managers and their consultants.</p><h2>Ethics and College Student Life: A Case Study Approach</h2><p><b> </b> This unique <i>hands-on</i> guide uses a highly effective case approach to explore specific, reality-based examples of the complex, controversial, and difficult ethical issues that students face on college campuses today&#x2013;e.g., plagiarism, racism and hate speech, date rape, alcohol abuse.

Mocked by other dragons for his small size and pure white color, Ruth is smart, brave, and loyal&#x2014;qualities that he shares with his rider, the young Lord Jaxom. Unfortunately, Jaxom is also looked down upon by his fellow lords, and by other riders as well. His dreams of joining the dragonriders in defending Pern are dismissed. What else can Jaxom and Ruth do but strike out on their own, pursuing in secret all they are denied? But in doing so, the two friends will find themselves facing a desperate choice&#x2014;one that will push their bond to the breaking point . . . and threaten the future of Pern itself.</p><p>There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorThe Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Indeed, as Angeles Arrien displays in this reissued edition of Signs of Life, shapes have significant psychological and mythological meanings embedded in our minds. Understanding the messages they convey and our attraction to them opens up a door to the secret workings of our inner selves and to a fuller appreciation of the art itself. As in her widely popular The Tarot Handbook, Arrien applies her background as a cultural anthropologist to the import human beings attribute to shapes. Examining her results, she has developed an effective tool to determine the connection between a person's preferences for certain shapes and the same person's inner, subjective states. In the course of using Arrien's book, individuals, parents, teachers, and therapists will experience the universal processes of growth embodied in images and myths.<p> Life, we discover, is art, and through Arrien's fascinating journey in Signs of Life, we gain a new perception of the omnipresent patterns and symbols that surround us.</p><p> Illustrated throughout with drawings and photographs</p></p><p><b>Angeles Arrien</b> is an anthropologist, educator, and award-winning author.

When it first appeared in 1811, the words in its title carried significant cultural weight beyond the confines of the novel, and into both popular and learned discourse. Through her dual heroines, Austen addresses, and satirizes, notions of sense and sensibility, and engages with the issues of inheritance, marriage, and love. </p> <p> The story concerns two sisters: the level-headed Elinor and the passionate and impulsive Marianne. When their father dies, his son by a previous marriage assumes possession of the family home. Marianne and Elinor, left to the care of their mercenary brother John and his wife Fanny, must remove to a cottage with their mother. Each sister meets a man in whom she is interested, and as with other Austen novels, requited love does not come easily. </p> <p> This newly annotated edition offers a thorough and perceptive introduction and a wide range of carefully selected contextual materials that further explore the term &#x201c;sensibility.&#x201d; </p></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>Strategies and Games: Theory and Practice</h2><p><p><b>Game theory has become increasingly popular among undergraduate aswell as business school students.

This text is the first to provide both a complete theoretical treatment of the subject and a variety of real-world applications, primarily in economics, but also in business, political science, and the law. <i>Strategies and Games</i> grew out of Prajit Dutta's experience teaching a course in game theory over the last six years at Columbia University.The book is divided into three parts: Strategic Form Games and Their Applications, Extensive Form Games and Their Applications, and Asymmetric Information Games and Their Applications. The theoretical topics include dominance solutions, Nash equilibrium, backward induction, subgame perfect equilibrium, repeated games, dynamic games, Bayes-Nash equilibrium, mechanism design, auction theory, and signaling. An appendix presents a thorough discussion of single-agent decision theory, as well as the optimization and probability theory required for the course.Every chapter that introduces a new theoretical concept opens with examples and ends with a case study. Case studies include Global Warming and the Internet, Poison Pills, Treasury Bill Auctions, and Final Jeopardy. Each part of the book also contains several chapter-length applications including Bankruptcy Law, the NASDAQ market, OPEC, and the Commons problem. This is also the first text to provide a detailed analysis of dynamic strategic interaction.</p></p><p>Prajit Dutta is Professor in the Department of Economics at Columbia University.<p>There is a profusion of game theory texts now available.

Everybody wears makeup and sings all the time. Even when they&#x2019;re singing your language, which is rare, you still can&#x2019;t understand the words. Women play men, men play women, and 45-year-olds play teenagers. All the main characters seem to get killed off. And when somebody dies, he takes ten minutes to sing about it. Yet, for all its weirdness, an operatic experience is an experience in breathtaking beauty.

Find out in <i>Opera For Dummies</i>.</p></p><p>Opera is growing--in the size of its audience, in the number of companies, in general interest--and is attracting a lot of attention among younger, more visually oriented people. But opera can be intimidating to the uninitiated: it's sung in foreign languages and has odd little customs (such as women singing the parts of young boys, and hefty middle-aged singers portraying teenaged lovers) that may be disconcerting at first. But opera needn't be at all intimidating, thanks to the miracle of supertitles (like subtitles, but projected above the stage), the advent of generations of singers who work at staying in shape, and the appearance of reference works like <i>Opera for Dummies</i> that are designed to remove the snobbery and mystery from opera. If you don't mind the flippant tone, IDG Books' <i>Opera for Dummies</i> makes an excellent guide for those who are new to this splendid art form. All of opera's details are explained clearly and without pretension; there's a lot of useful information packed into its 358 pages. The package includes an enhanced compact disc (listen to it in your stereo's CD player or in your computer's CD-ROM drive), with more than an hour of operatic excerpts from classic EMI releases. The illustrations, while not lavish, are adequate. <p> There are, however, a few glaring errors in this book that demand correction: Scott Speck and David Pogue confuse the opera chorus with the supers (the "extras" who march in armies, wait on tables, and never, ever sing), and--even worse--maintain that soloists and choristers are two entirely separate breeds. In fact, there's not a soloist alive who has never done chorus work--and choristers frequently do solo work as well. These are rather foolish mistakes for a pair of acclaimed experts to make in a book that wants to be taken as a basic guide to opera.</p>"Pogue is a wonderful teacher. . . .

This text is designed to cover the history of Western medicine from Classical Antiquity to 1800. As one guiding thread it takes the system of medical ideas that, in large part, went back to the Greeks of the fifth century B.C., and played a major role in the understanding and treatment of health and disease. The influence of Greek medicine spread from the Aegean basin to the rest of the Mediterranean region, to Europe, and then to European settlements overseas. By the nineteenth century, however, this tradition no longer carried the same force or occupied so central a position within medicine. This book charts the influence of this tradition through twenty centuries, examining it in its social and historical context. It is essential reading as a new synthesis for all students of the history of medicine.</p><p>Dating back to the fifth century B.C., Greek medical practice has significantly influenced Western medical tradition up to 1800 by playing a major role in the understanding and treatment of health and disease.

For several years prior to these lectures, Feynman thought long and hard about the fundamental problems in gravitational physics, yet he published very little. These lectures represent a useful record of his viewpoints and some of his insights into gravity and its application to cosmology, superstars, wormholes, and gravitational waves at that particular time. The lectures also contain a number of fascinating digressions and asides on the foundations of physics and other issues.Characteristically, Feynman took and untraditional non-geometric approach to gravitation and general relativity based on the underlying quantum aspects of gravity. Hence, these lectures contain a unique pedagogical account of the development of Einstein's general relativity as the inevitable result of the demand for a self-consistent theory of a massless spin-2 field (the graviton) coupled to the energy-momentum tensor of matter. This approach also demonstrates the intimate and fundamental connection between gauge invariance and the Principle of Equivalence.</p><p><b>David Pines</b> is research professor of physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Global catastrophes include volcanic eruptions, viral pandemics, wars, and large-scale terrorist attacks; trends are demographic, environmental, economic, and political shifts that unfold over time. In this provocative book, scientist Vaclav Smil takes a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at the catastrophes and trends the next fifty years may bring. Smil first looks at rare but cataclysmic events, both natural and human-produced, then at trends of global importance, including the transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources and growing economic and social inequality. He also considers environmental change--in some ways an amalgam of sudden discontinuities and gradual change--and assesses the often misunderstood complexities of global warming. <i>Global Catastrophes and Trends</i> does not come down on the side of either doom-and-gloom scenarios or techno-euphoria. Instead, Smil argues that understanding change will help us reverse negative trends and minimize the risk of catastrophe. </p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is the author of more than thirty books on energy, environment, food, and history of technical advances, including <i> Prime Movers of Globalization: The History and Impact of Diesel Engines and Gas Turbines</i> and <i>Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature</i>, both published by the MIT Press. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba. In 2010 he was named by <i>Foreign Policy</i> as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers.<p>"I think Smil should probably be set as homework for every Member of Parliament, and there <i>will</i> be a test later..."

His treatment of trends over the next fifty years is especially interesting, and his pages on America's 'retreat' informed and convincing. Smil offers not predictions but a balanced, holistic treatment of what may be ahead for humanity. Anyone interested in history, demography, economics, environmentalism, or risk analysis, along with globalization, will find this a 'must' book."--Bruce Mazlish, Professor of History Emeritus, MIT</p></p><h2>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress (Hendrickson Christian Classics)</h2><p>An allegorical account of Christian&#39;s journeys towards the Celestial City from the City of Destruction.</p><p>People of all ages have found delight in the simple, earnest story of Christian, the Pilgrim, as he makes his way to the Celestial City.Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>All the Presidents Men</h2><p>This landmark book details all the events of the biggest political scandal in the history of this nation--Watergate. Woodward and Bernstein kept the headlines coming, delivering revelation after amazing revelation to a shocked public. Black-and-white photograph section.</p><p><b>Carl Bernstein</b> and <b>Bob Woodward</b> are coauthors of <i>The Final Days</i> (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster), the behind-the-scenes account of Richard Nixon's last days in the White House. Carl Bernstein is the author of <i>Loyalties: A Son's Memoir.</i> Bob Woodward is the author of <i>The Commanders, Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-87, Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi,</i> and coauthor (with Scott Armstrong) of <i>The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court.</i><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> June 17, 1972. Nine o'clock Saturday morning. Early for the telephone. Woodward fumbled for the receiver and snapped awake. The city editor of the <i>Washington Post</i> was on the line. Five men had been arrested earlier that morning in a burglary at Democratic headquarters, carrying photographic equipment and electronic gear. Could he come in? </p><p> Woodward had worked for the Post for only nine months and was always looking for a good Saturday assignment, but this didn't sound like one. A burglary at the local Democratic headquarters was too much like most of what he had been doing -- investigative pieces on unsanitary restaurants and small-time police corruption. Woodward had hoped he had broken out of that; he had just finished a series of stories on the attempted assassination of Alabama Governor George Wallace. Now, it seemed, he was back in the same old slot. </p><p> Woodward left his one-room apartment in downtown Washington and walked the six blocks to the <i>Post.</i> The newspaper's mammoth newsroom -- over 150 feet square with rows of brightly colored desks set on an acre of sound-absorbing carpet -- is usually quiet on Saturday morning. Saturday is a day for long lunches, catching up on work, reading the Sunday supplements. As Woodward stopped to pick up his mail and telephone messages at the front of the newsroom, he noticed unusual activity around the city desk. He checked in with the city editor and learned with surprise that the burglars had not broken into the small local Democratic Party office but the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office-apartment-hotel complex. </p><p> It was an odd place to find the Democrats. The opulent Watergate, on the banks of the Potomac in downtown Washington, was as Republican as the Union League Club. Its tenants included the former Attorney General of the United States John N. Mitchell, now director of the Committee for the Re-election of the President; the former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans, finance chairman of the President's campaign; the Republican national chairman, Senator Robert Dole of Kansas; President Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods; and Anna Chennault, who was the widow of Flying Tiger ace Claire Chennault and a celebrated Republican hostess; plus many other prominent figures of the Nixon administration. </p><p> The futuristic complex, with its serpent's-teeth concrete balustrades and equally menacing prices ($100,000 for many of its two-bedroom cooperative apartments), had become the symbol of the ruling class in Richard Nixon's Washington. Two years earlier, it had been the target of 1000 anti-Nixon demonstrators who had shouted "Pigs," "Fascists" and <i>"Sieg Heil"</i> as they tried to storm the citadel of Republican power. They had run into a solid wall of riot-equipped Washington policemen who had pushed them back onto the campus of George Washington University with tear gas and billy clubs. From their balconies, anxious tenants of the Watergate had watched the confrontation, and some had cheered and toasted when the protesters were driven back and the westerly winds off the Potomac chased the tear gas away from the fortress. Among those who had been knocked to the ground was <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Carl Bernstein. The policeman who had sent him sprawling had probably not seen the press cards hanging from his neck, and had perhaps focused on his longish hair. </p><p> As Woodward began making phone calls, he noticed that Bernstein, one of the paper's two Virginia political reporters, was working on the burglary story, too. </p><p> Oh God, not Bernstein, Woodward thought, recalling several office tales about Bernstein's ability to push his way into a good story and get his byline on it. </p><p> That morning, Bernstein had Xeroxed copies of notes from reporters at the scene and informed the city editor that he would make some more checks. The city editor had shrugged his acceptance, and Bernstein had begun a series of phone calls to everybody at the Watergate he could reach -- desk clerks, bellmen, maids in the housekeeping department, waiters in the restaurant. </p><p> Bernstein looked across the newsroom. There was a pillar between his desk and Woodward's, about 25 feet away. He stepped back several paces. It appeared that Woodward was also working on the story. That figured, Bernstein thought. Bob Woodward was a prima donna who played heavily at office politics. Yale. A veteran of the Navy officer corps. Lawns, greensward, staterooms and grass tennis courts, Bernstein guessed, but probably not enough pavement for him to be good at investigative reporting. Bernstein knew that Woodward couldn't write very well. One office rumor had it that English was not Woodward's native language. </p><p> Bernstein was a college dropout. He had started as a copy boy at the <i>Washington Star</i> when he was 16, become a full-time reporter at 19, and had worked at the Post since 1966. He occasionally did investigative series, had covered the courts and city hall, and liked to do long, discursive pieces about the capital's people and neighborhoods. </p><p> Woodward knew that Bernstein occasionally wrote about rock music for the <i>Post.</i> That figured. When he learned that Bernstein sometimes reviewed classical music, he choked that down with difficulty. Bernstein looked like one of those counterculture journalists that Woodward despised. Bernstein thought that Woodward's rapid rise at the <i>Post</i> had less to do with his ability than his Establishment credentials. </p><p> They had never worked on a story together. Woodward was 29, Bernstein 28. </p><p> The first details of the story had been phoned from inside the Watergate by Alfred E. Lewis, a veteran of 35 years of police reporting for the <i>Post.</i> Lewis was something of a legend in Washington journalism -- half cop, half reporter, a man who often dressed in a blue regulation Metropolitan Police sweater buttoned at the bottom over a brass Star-of-David buckle. In 35 years, Lewis had never really "written" a story; he phoned the details in to a rewrite man, and for years the <i>Washington Post</i> did not even have a typewriter at police headquarters. </p><p> The five men arrested at 2:30 A.M. had been dressed in business suits and all had worn Playtex rubber surgical gloves. Police had seized a walkie-talkie, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35-millimeter cameras, lock picks, pen-size tear-gas guns, and bugging devices that apparently were capable of picking up both telephone and room conversations. </p><p> "One of the men had $814, one $800, one $215, one $234, one $230," Lewis had dictated. "Most of it was in $100 bills, in sequence....They seemed to know their way around; at least one of them must have been familiar with the layout. They had rooms on the second and third floors of the hotel? The men ate lobster in the restaurant there, all at the same table that night. One wore a suit bought in Raleigh's. Somebody got a look at the breast pocket." </p><p> Woodward learned from Lewis that the suspects were going to appear in court that afternoon for a preliminary hearing? He decided to go. </p><p> Woodward had been to the courthouse before. The heating procedure was an institutionalized fixture of the local court's turnstile system of justice: A quick appearance before a judge who set bond for accused pimps, prostitutes, muggers -- and, on this day, the five men who had been arrested at the Watergate. </p><p> A group of attorneys -- known as the "Fifth Street Lawyers" because of the location of the courthouse and their storefront offices -- were hanging around the corridors as usual, waiting for appointments as government-paid counsel to indigent defendants. Two of the regulars -- a tall, thin attorney in a frayed sharkskin suit and an obese, middle-aged lawyer who had once been disciplined for soliciting cases in the basement cellblock -- were muttering their distress. They had been tentatively appointed to represent the five accused Watergate burglars and had then been informed that the men had retained their own counsel, which is unusual. </p><p> Woodward went inside the courtroom. One person stood out. In a middle row sat a young man with fashionably long hair and an expensive suit with slightly flared lapels, his chin high, his eyes searching the room as if he were in unfamiliar surroundings. </p><p> Woodward sat down next to him and asked if he was in court because of the Watergate arrests. </p><p> "Perhaps," the man said. "I'm not the attorney of record. I'm acting as an individual." </p><p> He said his name was Douglas Caddy and he introduced a small, anemic-looking man next to him as the attorney of record, Joseph Rafferty, Jr. Rafferty appeared to have been routed out of bed; he was unshaven and squinted as if the light hurt his eyes. The two lawyers wandered in and out of the courtroom. Woodward finally cornered Rafferty in a hallway and got the names and addresses of the five suspects. Four of them were from Miami, three of them Cuban-Americans. </p><p> Caddy didn't want to talk. "Please don't take it personally," he told Woodward. "It would be a mistake to do that. I just don't have anything to say." </p><p> Woodward asked Caddy about his clients. </p><p> "They are not my clients," he said. </p><p> But you are a lawyer? Woodward asked. </p><p> "I'm not going to talk to you." </p><p> Caddy walked back into the courtroom. Woodward followed. </p><p> "Please, I have nothing to say." </p><p> Would the five men be able to post bond? Woodward asked. </p><p> After politely refusing to answer several more times, Caddy replied quickly that the men were all employed and had families -- factors that would be taken into consideration by the judge in setting bond. He walked back into the corridor. </p><p> Woodward followed: Just tell me about yourself, how you got into the case. </p><p> "I'm not in the case." </p><p> Why are you here? </p><p> "Look," Caddy said, "I met one of the defendants, Bernard Barker, at a social occasion. </p><p> "Where? </p><p> "In D.C. It was cocktails at the Army-Navy Club. We had a sympathetic conversation...that's all I'm going to say. </p><p> "How did you get into the case? </p><p> Caddy pivoted and walked back in. After half an hour, he went out again. </p><p> Woodward asked how he got into the case. </p><p> This time Caddy said he'd gotten a call shortly after 3:00 A.M. from Barker's wife. "She said her husband had told her to call me if he hadn't called her by three, that it might mean he was in trouble." </p><p> Caddy said he was probably the only attorney Barker knew in Washington, and brushed off more questions, adding that he had probably said too much. </p><p> At 3:30 P.M., the five suspects, still dressed in dark business suits but stripped of their belts and ties, were led into the courtroom by a marshal. They seated themselves silently in a row and stared blankly toward the bench, kneading their hands. They looked nervous, respectful and tough. </p><p> Earl Silbert, the government prosecutor, rose as their case was called by the clerk. Slight, intent and owlish with his horn-rimmed glasses, he was known as "Earl the Pearl" to Fifth Streeters familiar with his fondness for dramatic courtroom gestures and flowery speech. He argued that the five men should not be released on bond. They had given false names, had not cooperated with the police, possessed "$2300 in cold cash, and had a tendency to travel abroad." They had been arrested in a "professional burglary" with a "clandestine" purpose. Silbert drew out the word "clandestine." </p><p> Judge James A. Belsen asked the men their professions. One spoke up, answering that they were "anti-communists," and the others nodded their agreement. The Judge, accustomed to hearing unconventional job descriptions, nonetheless appeared perplexed. The tallest of the suspects, who had given his name as James W. McCord, Jr., was asked to step forward. He was balding, with a large, flat nose, a square jaw, perfect teeth and a benign expression that seemed incongruous with his hard-edged features. </p><p> The Judge asked his occupation. </p><p> "Security consultant," he replied. </p><p> The Judge asked where. </p><p> McCord, in a soft drawl, said that he had recently retired from government service. Woodward moved to the front row and leaned forward. </p><p> "Where in government?" asked the Judge. </p><p> "CIA," McCord whispered. </p><p> The Judge flinched slightly. </p><p> Holy shit, Woodward said half aloud, the CIA. </p><p> He got a cab back to the office and reported McCord's statement. Eight reporters were involved in putting together the story under the byline of Alfred E. Lewis. As the 6:30 P.M. deadline approached, Howard Simons, the <i>Post's</i> managing editor, came into the city editor's office at the south side of the newsroom. "That's a hell of a story," he told the city editor, Barry Sussman, and ordered it onto Sunday's front page. </p><p> The first paragraph of the story read: "Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, were arrested at 2:30 A.M. yesterday in what authorities described as an elaborate plot to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee here." </p><p> A federal grand jury investigation had already been announced, but even so it was Simons' opinion that there still were too many unknown factors about the break-in to make it the lead story. "It could be crazy Cubans," he said. </p><p> Indeed, the thought that the break-in might somehow be the work of the Republicans seemed implausible. On June 17, 1972, less than a month before the Democratic convention, the President stood ahead of all announced Democratic candidates in the polls by no less than 19 points. Richard Nixon's vision of an emerging Republican majority that would dominate the last quarter of the century, much as the Democrats had dominated two previous generations, appeared possible. The Democratic Party was in disarray as a brutal primary season approached its end. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, considered by the White House and Democratic Party professionals alike to be Nixon's weakest opponent, was emerging as the clear favorite to win the Democrats' nomination for President. </p><p> The story noted: "There was no immediate explanation as to why the five suspects would want to bug the Democratic National Committee offices, or whether or not they were working for any other individuals or organizations." </p><p> Bernstein had written another story for the Sunday paper on the suspects. Four were from Miami: Bernard L. Barker, Frank A. Sturgis, Virgilio R. Gonzalez and Eugenio R. Martinez. He had called a <i>Miami Herald</i> reporter and obtained a long list of Cuban exile leaders. A Post reporter had been sent from the President's press party in Key Biscayne to make checks in Miami's Cuban community. All four of the Miami suspects had been involved in anti-Castro activities and were also said to have CIA connections. ("I've never known if he works for the CIA or not," Mrs. Barker told Bernstein. "The men never tell the women anything about that.") Sturgis, an American soldier-of-fortune and the only non-Cuban among them, had been recruiting militant Cubans to demonstrate at the Democratic national convention, according to several persons. One Cuban leader told Bernstein that Sturgis and others wh...</p></p><h2>Is a Blue Whale the Biggest Thing There Is? (Wells of Knowledge Science Series)</h2><p>The blue whale is the biggest creature on Earth. But a hollow Mount Everest could hold billions of whales! And though Mount Everest is enormous, it is pretty small compared to the Earth. This book is an innovative exploration of size and proportion.</p><p>Robert E. Wells is an Albert Whitman author.Ages 4-8. In a picture book designed to expand children's horizons, Wells begins by comparing the hugeness of the blue whale with the relative smallness of an elephant. Next, he shows that even a tall tower of giant jars full of blue whales would be quite small compared with the size of Mount Everest. Even a tower of Mount Everests "would be a mere WHISKER on the face of the Earth," and so on, as he goes on to compare the size of the earth with that of the sun, and the sun with the red supergiant star Antares, which in turn is much smaller than our galaxy, which is tiny compared with the universe. What <i>How Much Is a Million</i> did for big numbers, this picture book does for big sizes, making the inconceivable more imaginable through original, concrete images: the earth as one of a packet of marbles dwarfed by the sun, or the sun as one orange in a crate that looks insignificant beside Antares. Lively ink-and-watercolor illustrations brighten the pages of this accessible concept book. The title and cover will draw a large audience of small children fascinated by big things. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Ideas into Words: Mastering the Craft of Science Writing</h2><p><p>"I am so proud to be Elise's student. Read this book and I suspect you will be too."&#x2015;from the foreword by Robert Kanigel, author of <i>The Man Who Knew Infinity</i></p><p>From the latest breakthroughs in medical research and information technologies to new discoveries about the diversity of life on earth, science is becoming both more specialized and more relevant. Consequently, the need for writers who can clarify these breakthroughs and discoveries for the general public has become acute. </p><p>In <i>Ideas into Words</i>, Elise Hancock, a professional writer and editor with thirty years of experience, provides both novice and seasoned science writers with the practical advice and canny insights they need to take their craft to the next level. Rich with real-life examples and anecdotes, this book covers the essentials of science writing: finding story ideas, learning the science, opening and shaping a piece, polishing drafts, overcoming blocks, and conducting interviews with scientists and other experts who may not be accustomed to making their ideas understandable to lay readers. </p><p>Hancock's wisdom will prove useful to anyone pursuing nonfiction writing as a career. She devotes an entire chapter to habits and attitudes that writers should cultivate, another to structure, and a third to the art of revision. Some of her advice is surprising (she cautions against slavish use of transitions, for example); all of it is hard-earned, astute, and wittily conveyed.

Yet despite the growing curiosity about Mexico due to increased trade and commerce, mostly resulting from NAFTA, as well as increased tourism and immigration, there is presently no up-to-date, accessible history of Mexico for general readers.<br> <em>The Oxford History of Mexico</em>, edited by Michael Meyer and William Beezley is a comprehensive, lucidly written, and fully current narrative history by twenty of the most esteemed historians of Mexico writing today. Drawing on radical changes in scholarship on Mexico over the past 15 years, <em>The</em> <em>Oxford History of Mexico</em> covers all aspects of the rich history of Mexico from precolonial times to the present. Exploring politics, religion, technology, modernization, ethnicity, colonialism, ecology, the arts, mass media, and popular culture, The Oxford History of Mexico provides a wealth of information for all readers interested in this remarkable country.<br>Fully illustrated, with black-and-white photos throughout and a sixteen page color insert, suggestions for future reading, an index, and a glossary, this is the fullest and most engaging history of Mexico available today.<br></p><p>With a population of nearly 100 million people, Mexico is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Although contemporary American images of the country range from illegal border crossings to peasant uprisings, this important work uncovers a vital and volatile civilization with its roots in the indigenous Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec cultures, which collided with the conquering Spaniards who brought African slaves with them in the 16th century. "The course of Mexican history, as with that of any other nation, demonstrates amply that sincerity and guile can occupy the same page," the editors write. "There is much in the Mexican experience to command admiration and ennoble the human spirit, even if on a few occasions it might also cause an eyebrow to be raised." <p> In <i>The Oxford History of Mexico</i>, 21 scholars unravel Mexico's long history of Indian extermination, slavery, colonialism, and U.S. expansion with new information outlining environmental, gender, and pop culture studies, particularly comic books and telenova soap operas. They also detail the cultural growth and development of this nation. Of course, the great historical figures are also given close attention: Montezuma, the great Aztec leader; Hern�n Cort�s, the conquistador who brought down the Aztec empire; Malinche, Cort�s' Indian mistress and interpreter; and Pancho Villa, who led the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Artistically, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, and Jos� Orozco are cited, as are writers such as Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, Octavio Paz, and Carlos Fuentes.

Neither, argues Philip Gorski in <i>American Covenant</i>. What the founders actually envisioned was a prophetic republic that would weave together the ethical vision of the Hebrew prophets and the Western political heritage of civic republicanism. In this ambitious book, Gorski shows why this civil religious tradition is now in peril&#x2015;and with it the American experiment.</p><p>Gorski traces the historical development of prophetic republicanism from the Puritan era to the present day. He provides close readings of thinkers such as John Winthrop, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Hannah Arendt, along with insightful portraits of recent and contemporary religious and political leaders such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Gorski shows how the founders' original vision for America is threatened by an internecine struggle between two rival traditions, religious nationalism and radical secularism. Religious nationalism is a form of militaristic hyperpatriotism that imagines the United States as a divine instrument in the final showdown between good and evil. Radical secularists fervently deny the positive contributions of the Judeo-Christian tradition to the American project and seek to remove all traces of religious expression from the public square. Gorski offers an unsparing critique of both, demonstrating how half a century of culture war has drowned out the quieter voices of the vital center.</p><p><i>American Covenant</i> makes the compelling case that if we are to rebuild that vital center, we must recover the civil religious tradition on which the republic was founded.</p></p><p><p>"Much has been written about how deeply divided we Americans are. Philip Gorski's <i>American Covenant</i> is an enormously thoughtful, innovative, and helpful book aimed at reopening conversation across our religious, cultural, and political divides. Even readers who disagree with him and with where he locates a new &#x2018;vital center' will profit from his deep understanding of American history and his brave effort to find a way for us to step aside from what so often feels like an eternal culture war."<b>--E. J. Dionne Jr., author of <i>Souled Out</i> and <i>Why the Right Went Wrong</i></b></p><p>"Philip Gorski's stimulating and original history of civil religion restarts a conversation begun by Robert Bellah at the height of the American involvement in Vietnam. It is a vital conversation again in the contemporary United States and Gorski offers a compelling vision of a patriotism that steers between a belligerent nationalism and a dismissal of all religious contributions. It's a learned and even necessary book."<b>--John T. McGreevy, author of <i>American Jesuits and the World</i></b></p><p>"Philip Gorski practices sociology in the grand tradition. <i>American Covenant</i> will be read and debated for decades to come. And it comes at just the right moment."<b>--Alan Wolfe, Boston College</b></p><p>"This engaging and ambitious book offers a sobering analysis that at the same time suggests hope for moving past the malignant divisiveness with which our nation is currently afflicted."<b>--Robert Wuthnow, author of <i>In the Blood: Understanding America's Farm Families</i></b></p><p>"Gorski provides a deep intellectual backdrop to the political mess we find ourselves in today."<b>--John Durham Peters, author of <i>The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media</i></b></p><b>Philip Gorski</b> is professor of sociology and religious studies at Yale University.

It presents haiku poets writing in English, Spanish, French, German, and five other languages on an equal footing with Japanese poets. Not only are the four great Japanese masters of the haiku represented (Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki) but also several major Western authors not commonly known to have written haiku. <br><br>The book presents a concise history of the Japanese haiku, including the dynamic changes throughout the twentieth century as the haiku has been adapted to suburban and industrial settings. Full chapters are offered on form, the seasons in haiku, and haiku craft, plus background on the Japanese poetic tradition, and the effect of translation on our understanding of haiku. <br><br>Other unique features are the lesson plans for both elementary and secondary school use; and lists of haiku publishers and magazines (in several languages). The Handbook concludes with a full reference section of haiku-related terms, bibliography, and a comprehensive season-word list to aid in understanding and appreciating Japanese haiku.</p><p><br>WILLIAM J.

Something tickles our ankle and, looking down to see what it is, we see more: </p><p>a baby crab<br> climbs up my leg--<br> such clear water </p><p>Or we are lying awake, alone with our thoughts, and as we turn to look at the clock </p><p>at midnight<br> a distant door<br> pulled shut </p><p>and we find ourselves more alone, because of the being on the other side of that door, than when we had no thoughts for others anywhere in the world. </p><p>The first of these two short poems was written about three hundred years ago by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho. The second is by a twentieth-century Japanese poet, Ozaki Hosai. Both poems are haiku. </p><p>Moments that can give rise to haiku are not foreign to the Americas. Mark Cramer has translated the following poem, originally written in Spanish by the Mexican poet Jose Juan Tablada a few years before Hosai wrote "at midnight": </p><p>Tender willow<br> almost gold, almost amber,<br> almost light... </p><p>And just recently New Jerseyan Penny Harter found </p><p>the old doll<br> her mama box broken<br> to half a cry </p><p>Haiku happen all the time, wherever there are people who are "in touch" with the world of their senses, and with their own feeling response to it.</p></p><h2>Red: The History of a Color</h2><p><p><b>A beautifully illustrated visual and cultural history of the color red throughout the ages</b></p><p>The color red has represented many things, from the life force and the divine to love, lust, and anger. Up through the Middle Ages, red held a place of privilege in the Western world. For many cultures, red was not just one color of many but rather the <i>only</i> color worthy enough to be used for social purposes. In some languages, the word for red was the same as the word for color. The first color developed for painting and dying, red became associated in antiquity with war, wealth, and power. In the medieval period, red held both religious significance, as the color of the blood of Christ and the fires of Hell, and secular meaning, as a symbol of love, glory, and beauty. Yet during the Protestant Reformation, red began to decline in status. Viewed as indecent and immoral and linked to luxury and the excesses of the Catholic Church, red fell out of favor. After the French Revolution, red gained new respect as the color of progressive movements and radical left-wing politics.</p><p>In this beautifully illustrated book, Michel Pastoureau, the acclaimed author of <i>Blue</i>, <i>Black</i>, and <i>Green</i>, now masterfully navigates centuries of symbolism and complex meanings to present the fascinating and sometimes controversial history of the color red. Pastoureau illuminates red's evolution through a diverse selection of captivating images, including the cave paintings of Lascaux, the works of Renaissance masters, and the modern paintings and stained glass of Mark Rothko and Josef Albers.</p></p><p><p>"Containing treasures of forgotten lore and many enjoyable anecdotes, <i>Red</i> adds a new chapter to Michel Pastoureau's extensive, erudite histories of color. Demonstrating the multiple meanings of color, this book reveals delightful details about pigments and dyes and navigates centuries of powerful and complex symbolism."<b>--Jean-Baptiste Evette, prize-winning French novelist and translator</b></p><p><i>Red</i> offers a social and cultural European history of red from antiquity to the twenty-first century. It is immensely engaging and lively, and at the same time takes up interesting and difficult questions of interpretation. Chock full of entertaining and surprising observations delivered with verve, this book will delight casual admirers of cultural history and serious scholars."<b>--David O'Brien, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</b></p><b>Michel Pastoureau</b> is a historian and director of studies at the �cole Pratique des Hautes �tudes de la Sorbonne in Paris. A specialist in the history of colors, symbols, and heraldry, he is the author of many books, including <i>Green</i>, <i>Black</i>, and <i>Blue</i> (all Princeton) and <i>The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes</i>. His books have been translated into more than thirty languages.</p><h2>American Education</h2><p>Joel Spring&#x2019;s <i>American Education</i> provides a clear, concise introduction to the historical, political, social, and legal foundations of education and to the profession of teaching in the United States. Students will come away with a strong knowledge of the forces behind the shaping of the American educational system through connecting with the latest topics, issues, and data.</p><p>Joel Spring received his Ph.D. in educational policy studies from the University of Wisconsin. He is currently a Professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. His great-great-grandfather was the first Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory and his grandfather, Joel S. Spring, was a local district chief at the time Indian Territory became Oklahoma. He currently teaches at Queens College of the City University of New York. His major research interests are history of education, multicultural education, Native American culture, the politics of education, global education, and human rights education. He is the author of over twenty books and the most recent are How Educational Ideologies are Shaping Global Society; Education and the Rise of the Global Economy; The Universal Right to Education: Justification, Definition, and Guidelines; Globalization and Educational Rights; and Educating the Consumer Citizen: A History of the Marriage of Schools, Advertising, and Media.</p><h2>Investment Science</h2><p>Fueled in part by some extraordinary theoretical developments in finance, an explosive growth of information and computing technology, and the global expansion of investment activity, investment theory currently commands a high level of intellectual attention. Recent developments in the field are being infused into university classrooms, financial service organizations, business ventures, and into the awareness of many individual investors. Modern investment theory using the language of mathematics is now an essential aspect of academic and practitioner training. <br> Representing a breakthrough in the organization of finance topics, <em>Investment Science</em> will be an indispensable tool in teaching modern investment theory. It presents sound fundamentals and shows how real problems can be solved with modern, yet simple, methods. David Luenberger gives thorough yet highly accessible mathematical coverage of standard and recent topics of introductory investments: fixed-income securities, modern portfolio theory and capital asset pricing theory, derivatives (futures, options, and swaps), and innovations in optimal portfolio growth and valuation of multiperiod risky investments. Throughout the book, he uses mathematics to present essential ideas of investments and their applications in business practice. The creative use of binomial lattices to formulate and solve a wide variety of important finance problems is a special feature of the book. <br> In moving from fixed-income securities to derivatives, Luenberger increases naturally the level of mathematical sophistication, but never goes beyond algebra, elementary statistics/probability, and calculus. He includes appendices on probability and calculus at the end of the book for student reference. Creative examples and end-of-chapter exercises are also included to provide additional applications of principles given in the text. <br> Ideal for investment or investment management courses in finance, engineering economics, operations research, and management science departments, <em>Investment Science</em> has been successfully class-tested at Boston University, Stanford University, and the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, and used in several firms where knowledge of investment principles is essential. Executives, managers, financial analysts, and project engineers responsible for evaluation and structuring of investments will also find the book beneficial. The methods described are useful in almost every field, including high-technology, utilities, financial service organizations, and manufacturing companies.</p><p><br>David G. Luenberger, Professor in Engineering-Economics Systems &amp; Operations Research, Stanford University. He has written several successful books with Addison-Wesley and John Wiley publishers.<br>"A great book. Professor Luenberger has created a masterpiece that can serve as both an excellent introduction for novices and as a rich source of examples and well explained fundamental principles for more advanced readers."--Milan Lukic, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh<br><br>"Outstanding book. Very intuitive development of a reasonably mathematical subject. Log-optimal integrated into main budget theory. Excellent."--Edwin T. Burton, University of Virginia<br><br>"An excellent text. It is unique in being as precise as a mathematically oriented reader could wish re: financial jargon."--Viswanath Ramakrishna, University of Texas at Dallas<br><br>Advance Praise<br><br>"Options and continuous-time finance are important enough to warrant a whole course in MBA programs. David Luenberger's book makes continuous time finance accessible to any student who has mastered elementary calculus and probability theory, and motivates the subject by using it to solve a<br>broad range of option-type problems relating to stock, bond, and commodity markets." -- Jack Treynor, President, Treynor Capital Management, Inc.<br><br>"This textbook takes a refreshing approach to the science of investing. It is extremely well-written. Financial principles and ideas are laid out clearly and in an orderly fashion. The proofs to theorems are elegant yet intuitive." -- Joseph Cherian, Department of Finance, School of<br>Management, Boston University<br><br>"Investment Science is a wonderful textbook treatment of investment theory for the quantitatively-minded undergraduate or masters student. This book is typical of David Luenberger's uncanny way of simplifying complex technical material without loss of rigor. He divides and conquers the<br>subject, starting with the basics of simple fixed-income securities, and building up to the valuation and hedging of derivative securities in a dynamic setting under uncertainty. There is a lovely interplay of arbitrage calculations, portfolio selection for individual investors, and market<br>equilibrium. The book will be especially valuable for those entering the subject from other quantitative fields."--Darrell Duffie, Stanford University Graduate School of Business<br><br>"The book is very clearly written and introduces advanced concepts (e.g. duration and convexity of bonds) in relatively simple and intuitive ways early in the book. There are lots of carefully thought out examples to illustrate important points and applications of particular methodologies.<br>Overall, the book does a great job of taking a reader who knows essentially nothing about finance from very basic concepts up through rather advanced valuation topics." -- James E. Hodder, University of Wisconsin-Madison<br><br>"This text is a breakthrough in the organization of very important theory." --Lloyd Nirenberg, Director, Business Development, National Semiconductor Corp.<br><br>"This book provides great insights and practical approaches for anyone interested in the relation between markets and decisions. It is written in a unique and creative manner." --Nick V. Arvanitidis, CEO,IDEA GmbH., and Former CEO, Sequus Pharmaceuticals</p><h2>Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph</h2><p>When Diane Arbus died in 1971 at the age of forty-eight, she was already a significant influence--even something of a legend--among serious photographers, although only a relatively small number of her most important pictures were widely known at the time. The publication of <i>Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph</i> in 1972--along with the posthumous retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art--offered the general public its first encounter with the breadth and power of her achievements. The response was unprecedented.<br><br>The monograph of eighty photographs was edited and designed by the painter Marvin Israel, Diane Arbus's friend and colleague, and by her daughter Doon Arbus. Their goal in making the book was to remain as faithful as possible to the standards by which Diane Arbus judged her own work and to the ways in which she hoped it would be seen. Universally acknowledged a classic, <i>Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph</i> is a timeless masterpiece with editions in five languages and remains the foundation of her international reputation.<br><br>This anniversary edition celebrates one of the most important photographic books in history on the work of a single artist. Every image in this edition has been printed from new three-hundred-line-screen duotone film, bringing to the reproductions a clarity and brilliance unattainable until now. A quarter of a century has done nothing to diminish the riveting impact of these pictures or the controversy they inspire. Arbus's photographs penetrate the psyche with all the force of a personal encounter and, in doing so, transform the way we see the world and the people in it.<br></p><p><i>Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph</i> was originally published in 1972, one year after the artist's death, in conjunction with a retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art. Edited and designed by Arbus's daughter, Doon, and her friend and colleague, painter Marvin Israel, the monograph contains eighty of her most masterful photos. The images in this newly published edition, marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the collection's original publication, were printed from new three-hundred-line-screen duotone film, allowing for startlingly clear reproduction. The impact of the collection is heightened by the introduction, which contains excerpts of audio tapes in which Arbus discusses her experiences as a photographer and her feelings about the often bizarre nature of her subjects. Diane Arbus's work has indelibly impacted modern visual sensibilities, evidenced by the intensely personal moments captured in this powerful group of photographs.<b>Diane Arbus</b>--born Diane Nemerov in New York City in 1923--married Allan Arbus at the age of eighteen. She started taking pictures in the early 1940's and studied photography with Berenice Abbott in the late 1940's and with Alexey Brodovitch in the mid 1950's. It was Lisette Model's photographic workshops, however, that inspired her, around 1957, to begin seriously pursuing the work for which she has come to be known.<br><br>Her first published photographs appeared in <i>Esquire</i> in 1960. During the next decade, working for <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, and other major magazines, she published more than a hundred pictures, including portraits and photographic essays, many of which originated as personal projects, occasionally accompanied by her own writing. <i>Diane Arbus: Magazine Work</i> (Aperture, 1984) documents this aspect of her career and its relationship to her best-known imagery.<br><br>In 1963 and 1966 she was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships for her project on "American Rites, Manners, and Customs." She traveled across the country, photographing the people, places, and events she described as "the considerable ceremonies of our present These are our symptoms and our monuments," she wrote. "I want simply to save them, for what is ceremonious and curious and commonplace will be legendary."<br><br>A selected group of these photographs attracted a great deal of critical and popular attention when they were featured, along wit the work of two other photographers, in the Museum of Modern Art's 1967 exhibition "New Documents." The boldness of her subject matter and photographic approach were recognized as revolutionary.<br><br>In the late 1960's, Arbus taught photography at Parsons School of Design, the Rhode Island School of Design, and Cooper Union, and continued to make photographs. Notable among her late works is a series of photographs she took at residences for the mentally retarded. <i>Untitled</i> (Aperture, 1995) is a collection of fifty-one of these photographs. "The extraordinary power of <i>Untitled</i> confirms our earliest impression of Arbus's work," wrote Hilton Als in the <i>New Yorker</i>. "It is as iconographic as it gets in any medium. These pictures are purely ecstatic."<br><br>In 1970, Arbus made a portfolio of ten prints, which was intended to be the first in a series of limited editions of her work. She committed suicide in July of 1971. In the years following her death and the Museum of Modern Art's posthumous retrospective--which was seen by more than a quarter of a million people before it began its three-year tour of the United States and Canada--exhibitions devoted exclusively to her work have been mounted throughout Western Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. To this day critics continue to debate the meaning of her photographs and the intentions behind them. Their indelible imprint on our visual experience has long been established beyond dispute.<br></p><h2>Deviance and Social Control: A Sociological Perspective</h2><p><strong>Deviance and Social Control: A Sociological Perspective, <em>Second Edition </em></strong>serves as a guide to students delving into the fascinating world of deviance for the first time.

In other words, the culture helped us acquire the self-control necessary to create a flourishing existence. Those days are over.

I appreciated the author&#x2019;s self-effacing tone, and his invitation to ride shotgun on his personal road trip to discovering the ability and virtue of self-control.

It contains a fierce protest against Christianity, holding it responsible for both the dehumanizing of men and women and the self-glorification of the weak that has brought about &#34;the reign of the pseudo-humble&#34;. He also argues against the importance given to all things scientific that places formulae above feelings and reduces the spirit of mankind.</p><p>Apocalypse is a radical criticism of our civilisation and a statement of Lawrence&#39;s belief in man&#39;s power to create &#39;a new heaven and a new earth&#39;. This edition is the first to reproduce Lawrence&#39;s final corrected text on the basis of a thorough examination of the surviving manuscript and typescript.Written during the winter of 1929-30 and his last major work, Apocalypse is Lawrence&#39;s radical criticism of the political, religious and social structures that have shaped Western civilization. In his view the perpetual conflict within man, in which emotion, instinct and the senses vie with the intellect and reason, has resulted in society&#39;s increasing alienation from the natural world. Yet Lawrence&#39;s belief in humanity&#39;s power to regain the imaginative and spiritual values which alone can revitalize our world also makes Apocalypse a powerful statement of hope. Presenting his thoughts on psychology, science, politics, art, God and man, and including a fierce protest against Christianity, Apocalypse is Lawrence&#39;s last testament, his final attempt to convey his vision of man and of the cosmos.</p><h2>Energy Calculations and Problem Solving Sourcebook: A Practical Guide for the Certified Energy Manager Exam</h2><p><p>Based on the Body of Knowledge, this book is designed to serve as a practical guide for energy professionals preparing to take AEE&#x2019;s Certified Energy Manager� (CEM�) examination.

In this work, Mill defines liberty as an absolute individual right, and defends freedom of speech as a necessary condition of social and intellectual progress.Together, these two essays mark the philosophic cornerstone of democratic morality and represent a thought-provoking search for the true balance between the rights of the individual and the power of the state. Thoroughly schooled in the principles of the utilitarian movement founded by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill nevertheless brings his own unique intellectual energy to issues such individual freedom, equality, authority, happiness, justice, and virtue. &#34;On Liberty is Mill&#39;s famous examination of the nature of individuality and its crucial role in any social system that expected to remain creative and vital. Utilitarian brilliantly expounds a pragmatic ethic based on one controversial proposition: actions are right only if they promote the common good and wrong if they do not. While much of Mill&#39;s thinking was eventually adopted by socialists, it is in today&#39;s democratic societies--with their troubling issues of crime, freedom of speech, and the boundaries of personal liberty--that his work resounds most powerfully.</p><h2>The Body Clock in Traditional Chinese Medicine: Understanding Our Energy Cycles for Health and Healing</h2><p>A reference guide to understanding the natural rhythm of our organs and learning to support them in a holistic way <br><br>� Explains the Organ Body Clock from Traditional Chinese Medicine and which organs and meridians are dominant during different hours of the day <br><br>� Describes exactly what happens inside the body during each organ&#x2019;s active time and shows what we can do to support the organs with plant medicine, homeopathy, our behavior, and simple daily practices <br><br>� Explores the mental and emotional states each organ is related to and their connections to the teeth, the other organs, and the Five Elements of TCM <br><br>All of our organs are energetically interconnected. They each have regular rest and active cycles throughout the day, with different organs becoming dominant at different hours. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, this is known as the Organ Body Clock. <br><br>In this accessible guide to the body clock in Traditional Chinese Medicine, the author shows how to support the body&#x2019;s natural rhythms of activity, recognize the body&#x2019;s signals of imbalance and find their sources, and achieve healing on the physical and energetic levels. He explains how the body clock can provide deep insight into our physical and energetic health. For example, if we always wake up at a certain time at night, we should look up which organ is associated with that time, which will lead us to discover the part of our body that needs special attention and help. The author explores the 12 major organs of the body, describing their active and rest hours, their function inside the body, the mental and emotional states they are related to, and their connections to the teeth, the other organs, and the Five Elements of TCM. The author describes exactly what happens inside the body during each organ&#x2019;s active time and shows what we can do to support the organs with plant medicine, homeopathy, our behavior, and simple daily practices. <br><br>By working with the body clock and better understanding our bodies&#x2019; rhythms, we more easily trace our ailments and conditions to their source for faster relief, sustainable healing, and energetic balance.</p><p>Lothar Ursinus has been a naturopath for over 30 years. He is known for developing his own method of analysis that interprets results from laboratories not only on a scientific level but also on a naturopathic, mental, and holistic level. He gives seminars for both naturopaths and doctors on this method. He lives in Hamburg, Germany.<b>Spleen and pancreas:</b><i> Thinking and relationships</i> <br><br><b><i>Organ time</i></b><br><br><i>9am to 11am strongest activity<br><br>9pm to 11pm weakest activity</i> <br><br>The spleen and pancreas are considered to be a unit. They are powerful representatives of the body&#x2019;s core and are closely connected with the development of an individual&#x2019;s personality (which, however, can only begin when a person can draw a line between the self and the outside world). On a physical level, the immune system helps us to distinguish between &#x201c;me&#x201d; and &#x201c;not me.&#x201d; The spleen protects what is within us and is a powerful barricade against intruding foreign bodies, making it one of the most important organs in the immune system. The spleen&#x2019;s primary function is to monitor the quality of every red blood cell, and any red blood cells that are over 120 days old or have become unstable are broken down. New blood is formed after this purification process and the hemoglobin freed up is sent to the liver, which uses it to create bilirubin. Previously life-giving red blood is transformed in the liver into a viscous, bitter greenish liquid that is passed to the gall bladder in a unique metamorphosis that illustrates clearly the close link between the spleen and the biliary system. <br><br>When people are unable to establish a boundary between themselves and outside influences, they can be overcome by sensations, resulting in a sense of mental defenselessness. By the same token, some people are capable of shutting themselves off from the outside world entirely, becoming willful or developing autistic tendencies. Such people have no emotional contact with others and become wrapped up within themselves and shut off from the outside world. Numerous studies have shown that use of the hormone secretin, which stimulates the pancreas, may help many autistic people. <br><br><i><b>Quality: thinking</b></i> <br><br>The spleen and pancreas are able to pick up impressions and thoughts in order for them to be recast and incorporated into something that is all our own. For the body, this means creating the tiniest elements of proteins from a piece of meat and constructing the body&#x2019;s own cells from these. For the mind, it means developing your own opinion or conviction from input received from elsewhere. Given our dietary habits and society&#x2019;s emphasis on the cerebral, the spleen and pancreas are an extremely overworked organ system. Our diet is generally too cold, too heavy, too fatty, and too carbohydrate-based. Overall, we eat too much, too quickly, too late in the day, and without enough control, placing an excessive burden on the spleen and pancreas in the same way that constant intellectual effort does. <br><br><b><i>Quality: relationships</i></b> <br><br>As mentioned earlier, the spleen and pancreas are controlled (along with the stomach) via the neural node at the solar plexus. This area is also known as the third chakra and is the seat of our personality. <br><br>Every relationship, whether personal or professional, will invariably also possess an emotional quality. We consciously (and indeed, unconsciously) maintain emotional contact with others via the solar plexus, thereby an ability to enter into a relationship can be traced back to the activity of stomach, spleen, and pancreas. <br><br><b><i>Sensory organs</i></b> <br><br>The condition of your lips is connected with the strength of your spleen and pancreas. Dry lips are always a sign of weakness in these two organs. Spending your whole life moistening your lips is clearly not the best option and it would make more sense to check your spleen and pancreas, activating them if necessary. <br><br><b><i>Links to other organs</i></b> <br><br>The spleen and pancreas have a physiological connection to the small intestine and colon, the digestive organs that are next in line. As discussed, the spleen is also considered the source of bile and thus maintains very close contact with the liver. The pancreas is part of a chain of glands consisting of the parotid gland, the pancreas, and the gonads (ovaries or testes). <br><br><b><i>Diabetes mellitus</i></b> <br><br>Diabetes mellitus presents as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. In Type 1, the pancreas stops producing insulin, and conventional medicine categorizes this as an autoimmune illness. Type 2 diabetes, also known as &#x201c;adult onset diabetes&#x201d; or &#x201c;metabolic syndrome,&#x201d; is the result of a lifestyle that is not &#x201c;right for our species.&#x201d; Long periods of stress or too much stress, too many quick-release carbohydrates, and too little exercise are the decisive factors that result in this very common disease.<br><br>The trigger factors for metabolic syndrome play a key role in its treatment. Diet, exercise, and relaxation are the main pillars of any therapy. Individual dietary therapy with the &#x201c;healthy &amp; active&#x201d; program I developed 13 years ago is the most important component in the treatment of diabetes. Decisions about additional treatment with herbal or homeopathic remedies are made based on the results of comprehensive physical and metabolic analysis drawn from at least 64 lab test results. <br><br><i><b>What else happens in the body between 9am and 11am? <br></b></i><br>The body is extremely resilient during this period, which is why it is a good time for surgical operations or X-rays. Wound healing also takes place at a faster rate. The short-term memory is at its most receptive and overall mental learning abilities are at their highest. <br><br><i><b>What is good for the spleen and pancreas?</b></i> <br><br>Activities and situations benefiting the solar plexus include visiting friends, a kind word, a flattering gesture, together with confirmation, praise, and recognition. Anything that helps us identify our path to our inner purpose is good for the spleen and pancreas. <br><br>Mother tincture of chicory (<i>Ceres Cichorium intybus</i>) is a remedy often prescribed in my practice; it lifts us out of over-thinking yesterday and tomorrow and positions us clearly in the moment, in the here and now. Chicory helps us to make decisions and find clarity and focus on what is essential. It assists us along our path to our inner purpose, our inner self.</p><h2>Taras Bulba (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b>The First New Translation in Forty Years</b><br><br>Set sometime between the mid-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century, Gogol&#x2019;s epic tale recounts both a bloody Cossack revolt against the Poles (led by the bold Taras Bulba of Ukrainian folk mythology) and the trials of Taras Bulba&#x2019;s two sons.<br><br>As Robert Kaplan writes in his Introduction, &#x201c;[<i>Taras Bulba</i>] has a Kiplingesque gusto . . . that makes it a pleasure to read, but central to its theme is an unredemptive, darkly evil violence that is far beyond anything that Kipling ever touched on. We need more works like <i>Taras Bulba</i> to better understand the emotional wellsprings of the threat we face today in places like the Middle East and Central Asia.&#x201d; And the critic John Cournos has noted, &#x201c;A clue to all Russian realism may be found in a Russian critic&#x2019;s observation about Gogol: &#x2018;Seldom has nature created a man so romantic in bent, yet so masterly in portraying all that is unromantic in life.&#x2019; But this statement does not cover the whole ground, for it is easy to see in almost all of Gogol&#x2019;s work his &#x2018;free Cossack soul&#x2019; trying to break through the shell of sordid today like some ancient demon, essentially Dionysian. So that his works, true though they are to our life, are at once a reproach, a protest, and a challenge, ever calling for joy, ancient joy, that is no more with us. And they have all the joy and sadness of the Ukrainian songs he loved so much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of the ten greatest books of all time.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ernest Hemingway<b>Peter Constantine</b> was awarded the 1998 PEN Translation Award for <i>Six Early Stories</i> by Thomas Mann and the 1999 National Translation Award for <i>The Undiscovered Chekhov: Forty-Three New Stories</i>, and has been widely acclaimed for his recent translation of the complete works of Isaac Babel.

Writing from a 19th-century perspective and poignantly critical of his own time, Bellamy advanced a remarkable vision of the future, including such daring predictions as the existence of radio, television, motion pictures, and credit cards.<br>On the surface, the novel is the story of time-traveler Julian West, a young Bostonian who is put into a hypnotic sleep in the late 19th century, and awakens in the year 2000 in a socialist utopia. Crime, war, personal animosity, and want are nonexistent. Equality of the sexes is a fact of life. In short, a messianic state of brotherly love is in effect.<br>Entertaining, stimulating, and thought-provoking, <i>Looking Backward </i>is a provocative study of human society as it is and as it might be.</p><p></p></p><h2>Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex, Second Edition</h2><p>Pathologized, terrorized, and confined, trans/gender non-conforming and queer folks have always struggled against the prison industrial complex. Eric A. Stanley and Nat Smith bring together current and former prisoners, activists, and academics for a new understanding of how race, gender, ability, and sexuality are lived under the crushing weight of captivity. Through a politic of gender self-determination, this collection argues that trans/ queer liberation and prison abolition must be grown together. From rioting against police violence and critiquing hate crimes legislation, to prisoners demanding access to HIV medications, and far beyond, Captive Genders is a challenge for us all to join the struggle. This expanded second edition includes a new foreword from CeCe McDonald and essays by Chelsea Manning, Kalaniopua Young, and Janetta Louise Johnson and Toshio Meronek.</p><p><b>Eric Stanley </b>works at the intersection of radical trans/queer politics, abolitionist study, and critical theory.

The anthology contributors share transformational insights, mini-memoirs, analyses and theories about captivity. Their writings lead and nurture us to a deeper understanding and struggle for justice with freedom and peace."&nbsp; <br><b>-Joy James, author of Seeking the Beloved Community&nbsp;</b><br>"Captive Genders is an essential book that brings home that trans and gender non-conforming lives are deeply structured by the prison, that violence can never be an antidote to violence, that abolition must extend to the gender binary, and that formerly incarcerated Black trans women will lead the way." <br><b>-Jin Haritaworn, author of Queer Lovers and Hateful Others: Regenerating Violent Times and Places</b><br><br>"The powerful analysis and compelling arguments in this collection force readers to conclude that the political and theoretical connection between prison abolition and trans and queer liberation is fundamental to social transformation and justice."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>-Beth E.

It is unrivalled in forming the basis of the way we view the universe and the many surprises that the theory has in store -- the characteristics of black holes, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves, and the sheer scope and profundity of current cosmology excite all students of relativity. The aim of this textbook is to provide students with a sound mathematical introduction coupled to an understanding of the physical insights needed to explore the subject. The book follows Einstein in that it introduces the basic field equations by discussing the relativistic theory of gravitation from a physics point of view, and the structure on the resulting equations is discussed carefully before going on to their solution in simple settings. The book is designed with two objectives: to familiarize students with the basic ideas and equations of the theory, and to cover three main topics: black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology. Throughout, the author has included numerous exercises (of varying degrees of difficulty) to illustrate and extend the ideas covered. As a result, this book will make an excellent first course for any student coming to the subject for the first time.<br></p><p>Ray d&#39;Inverno is at University of Southampton.`Ray d'Inverno's Introducing Einstein's Relativity seems to have done a wonderful job of taming what many undergraduates consider a ferocious course.

As different in their personalities as they are alike in their devotion to each other, the girls vow to support their beloved mother, Marmee, by behaving their best while Father is away, serving as an army chaplain in the Civil War.<br>Literary-minded tomboy Jo develops a fast friendship with the boy next door, and pretty Meg, the eldest, finds romance; frail and affectionate Beth fills the house with music, and little Amy, the youngest, seeks beauty with all the longing of an artist's soul. Although poor in material wealth, the family possesses an abundance of love, friendship, and imaginative gifts that captivate readers time and again.</p><h2>The Prince and the Pauper (Signet Classics)</h2><p><b>Two boys exchange their clothes and their lives in Mark Twain's classic satiric comedy.</b><br><br> They are the same age. They look alike. In fact, there is but one difference between them: Tom Canty is a child of the London slums; Edward Tudor is heir to the throne of England. Just how insubstantial this difference really is becomes clear when a chance encounter leads to an exchange of roles...with the pauper caught up in the pomp and folly of the royal court, and the prince wandering, horror-stricken, through the lower depths of sixteenth-century English society. <br><br>Out of the theme of switched identities, Mark Twain has fashioned both a scathing attack upon social hypocrisy and injustice and an irresistible comedy imbued with the sense of high-spirited play that belongs to his most creative period.<br><br><b>With an Afterword by Everett Emerson&nbsp;</b></p><p>Rich with surprise and hilarious adventure, <i>The Prince And The Pauper</i> is a delight satire of England's romantic past and a joyful boyhood romp filled with the same tongue-in-cheek irony that sparked the best of Mark Twain's tall tales. Two boys, one an urchin from London's filthy lanes, the other a prince born in a lavish palace, unwittingly trade identities. Thus a bedraggled "Prince of Poverty" discovers that his private dreams have all the come true -- while a pampered Prince of Wales finds himself tossed into a rough-and-tumble world of squalid beggars and villainous thieves. Originally written as a story for children, <i>The Prince And The Pauper</i> is a classic novel for adults as well -- through its stinging attack on the ageless human folly of attempting to measure true worth by outer appearances.This treasured historical satire, played out in two very different socioeconomic worlds of 16th-century England, centers around the lives of two boys born in London on the same day: Edward, Prince of Wales, and Tom Canty, a street beggar. During a chance encounter, the two realize they are identical and, as a lark, decide to exchange clothes and roles&#x2014;a situation that briefly, but drastically, alters the lives of both youngsters.<br>The Prince, dressed in rags, wanders about the city's boisterous neighborhoods among the lower classes and endures a series of hardships; poor Tom, now living with the royals, is constantly filled with the dread of being discovered for who and what he really is.<br>Brimming with gentle humor and discerning social scrutiny, this timeless tale of transposed identities remains one of Twain's most popular and best-loved novels.</p><h2>The Republic of Letters (The Margellos World Republic of Letters)</h2><p><b>A provocative exploration of intellectual exchange across four centuries of European history by the author of </b><i><b>When the World Spoke French</b></i><br><br> In this fascinating study, preeminent historian Marc Fumaroli reveals how an imagined &#x201c;republic&#x201d; of ideas and interchange fostered the Italian Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution. He follows exchanges among Petrarch, Erasmus, Descartes, Montaigne, and others from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries, through revolutions in culture and society. Via revealing portraits and analysis, Fumaroli traces intellectual currents engaged with the core question of how to live a moral life&#x2014;and argues that these men of letters provide an example of the exchange of knowledge and ideas that is worthy of emulation in our own time.

She married in 1925, and spent the following ten years putting down on paper the stories she had heard about the Civil War. The result was Gone With The Wind, first published in 1936. It won the Pulitzer price, sold over ten million copies, was translated into eighteen languages and was later made into one of the best-loved films of all time starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. This book, a record bestseller, was her only published work. She died in 1949."Fascinating and unforgettable! A remarkable book, a spectacular book, a book that will not be forgotten!" -- "Chicago Tribune"<br><br>"I first read "Gone with the Wind" in grade school--a boy of the upper South who'd seen the great movie and felt compelled to learn what lay behind it, all thousand-plus pages worth. No page disappointed me. What other American novel surpasses its eagerness to tell a great story of love and war; what characters equal the cantankerous passions of Scarlett and Rhett? Even Scott Fitzgerald spoke well of it. What more could I ask, even seven decades later?" -- Reynolds Price<br><br>"GWTW is an indelible portrait of a unique time and place, American's greatest political and moral conflict, and the myths that surround it -- an all absorbing spectacle of a read even for postmodern readers. Mitchell vividly portrays the disillusionment and devastation of war, the ignorance of the uninitiated, and the transformation of arrogance into tenacity that shaped the first "new South." All the details of history and place come together as a rich backdrop for those unforgettable characters: shallow and selfish Scarlett, sincere Melanie, moony-eyed Ashley, and the sage, pragmatic, dashing, and rakish Rhett Butler--the most enduring heartthrob of American literature has produced. I'd reread the book for the thrill of Rhett alone!" -- Darnell Arnoult, author of "Sufficient Grace"<br><br>"In 1936 I was in E.M. Daggett Junior High in Ft. Worth, Texas. By some chance I was able to read "Gone with the Wind" early on. Then and now, I found it one of the great experiences of a young life. I still list it as one of my 10 favorite books." -- Liz Smith, nationally syndicated columnist<br><br>"Beyond a doubt one of the most remarkable first novels produced by an American writer. It is also one of the best." -- "The New York Times"<br><br>"Not just a great love story, "Gone with the Wind" is one of the most powerful anti-war novels ever written. Told from the standpoint of the women left behind, author Margaret Mitchell brilliantly illustrates the heartbreaking and devastating effects of war on the land and its people." -- Fannie Flagg, Academy Award nominated-author<br><br>"The best novel to have ever come out of the South...it is unsurpassed in the whole of American writing." -- "The Washington Post"<br><br>"Let's say you've read "Gone with the Wind" at least twice, and seen the movie over and again. So, here's a thought. Buy this handsome paperback edition, just for Pat Conroy's preface. This passionate, nearly breathless love letter is a Song of Solomon to Margaret Mitchell, Scarlett O'Hara, and Conroy's beautiful, GTW-obsessed mother. Indeed, his luminous preface packs a durable wallop, just like the epic Pulitzer prize-winning work that inspires it." -- Jan Karon, author of "The Mitford Years" series<br><br>"In my own personal life, I find many similarities to Scarlett's: The whole 17-inch waist thing notwithstanding, I do love a barbecue, both for the food and the men--I have been known to "eat like a field hand and gobble like a hawg"--I admit that at least on one occasion I may have feigned interest in some guy to further my own interests--I have fought tooth, toenail and tirelessly for my family--I learn slow but I learn good--and even so, I still adore the prospect of dealing with most things...Tomorrow." -- Jill Conner Browne, The Sweet Potato Queen, bestselling author of "The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel"<br><br>""Gone with the Wind" is one of those rare books that we never forget. We read it when we're young and fall in love with the characters, then we watch the film and read the book again and watch the film again and never get tired of revisiting an era that is the most important in our history. Rhett and Scarlet and Melanie and Ashley and Big Sam and Mammy and Archie the convict are characters who always remain with us, in the same way that Twain's characters do. No one ever forgets the scene when Scarlet wanders among the wounded in the Atlanta train yard; no one ever forgets the moment Melanie and Scarlet drag the body of the dead Federal soldier down the staircase, a step at a time. "Gone with the Wind" is an epic story. Anyone who has not read it has missed one of the greatest literary experiences a reader can have." -- James Lee Burke, bestselling author of "The Tin Roof Blowdown "</p><h2>Envision Math 2.0 Student Edition Grade 6 Volume 1 Copyright 2017</h2><p>In like new condition, having never been issued.

Three years later, it was finally published, and its curious effect of half-dream, half-nightmare instantly captured the imagination of readers of all ages.</p><p>This new edition brings together the unabridged text with more than 70 stunning illustrations by Ingpen, each reflecting the artist&#x2019;s unique style and extraordinary imagination and the spirit of this eternally popular masterpiece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Here is a book that with a few hours of reading will enable anyone to cast his or her own chart. It gives explanations of the influences that are often given scant attention in conventional astrology books: the moon signs, the rising sun, the placement of the planets, and the significance of the twelve houses. Woolfolk also discusses astrology in history and legend. Easy to use, this book supplies simplified tables that in most cases require only the laying down of a ruler across the birthdate.</p><p>Joanna Martine Woolfolk is the author of <i>Sexual Astrology</i>, under the name Martine. She lives in Stamford, CT.Although this is not the only astrology book that your library will ever need, it is still a valuable title that should be strongly considered. Woolfolk, the horoscope columnist for Marie Claire and Redbook magazines, has updated her classic guide for the first time in 19 years. Thoroughly covered here are sun signs, moon signs, planets, and the significance of the 12 zodiacal houses, as well as the most recent discoveries in astronomy and 21st-century projections. The author gives an easy, logical way to integrate the interpretations of the sun signs, moon signs, planets, and houses in any given chart, something not easily done or often seen in general astrology books. The book's only shortcoming is its lack of instruction on making a detailed technical chart, which is necessary if one is to cast a complete and accurate horoscope. However, Woolfolk compensates for this by teaching a simplified method that is about 90 percent accurate enough to get a beginner started and includes a bibliography for further instruction. Astronomical tables are included to help cast the simplified chart. A great bargain for the price, this is highly recommended for all astrology collections.

Author Young disagrees with long held notions that Hellenism was the context which most influenced Paul's communication of the Gospel. This skewed notion has led to widely divergent interpretations of Paul's writings. Only in rightly aligning Paul as rooted in his Jewishness and training as a Pharisee can he be correctly interpreted. Young asserts that Paul's view of the Torah was always positive, and he separates Jesus' mission among the Jews from Paul's call to the Gentiles.<p>"The Pharisee Saul of Tarsus is arguably one of the most influential religious figures in the history of Western culture. . . .

In this disturbing new book, Lovelock guides us toward a hard reality: soon, we may not be able to alter the oncoming climate crisis. Lovelock's influential Gaia theory, one of the building blocks of modern climate science, conceives of the Earth, including the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and upper layers of rock, as a single living super-organism, regulating its internal environment much as an animal regulates its body temperature and chemical balance. But now, says Lovelock, that organism is sick. It is running a fever born of the combination of a sun whose intensity is slowly growing over millions of years, and an atmosphere whose greenhouse gases have recently spiked due to human activity. Earth will adjust to these stresses, but on time scales measured in the hundreds of millennia. It is already too late, Lovelock says, to prevent the global climate from flipping&#x201d; into an entirely new equilibrium state that will leave the tropics uninhabitable, and force migration to the poles. <i>The Revenge of Gaia</i> explains the stress the planetary system is under and how humans are contributing to it, what the consequences will be, and what humanity must do to rescue itself.</p><p><b>James Lovelock</b> is the originator of Gaia Theory, on which he has written several books. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974. He has received honorary Doctorates in Science from seven universities in England, Sweden, and the United States. He was made a C.B.E. in 1990, and in 2003 a Companion of Honour by Her Majesty the Queen. He lives in Cornwall, Britain.<i>Starred Review.</i> The end is all but nigh for Mother Earth's inhabitants unless drastic measures are soon taken: that's the rueful prognostication delivered by Lovelock (<i>Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth</i>), intuitive originator of the theory that the world is a self-regulating system that, over the eons, has been able to sustain an equilibrium between hot and cold so as to support life. Now, propelled by global warming, Lovelock says, a tipping point has almost been reached beyond which the Earth will not recover sufficiently to sustain human life comfortably. Lovelock dismisses biomass fuels, wind farms, solar energy and fuel cell innovations as technologies unlikely to mitigate greenhouse gases in time to save the planet. Instead he sees nuclear energy as the only energy source that can meet our needs in time to prevent catastrophe. Chernobyl was a calamity, he notes, but nuclear power's danger is "insignificant compared with the real threat of intolerable and lethal heatwaves" and rising sea levels that could "threaten every coastal city of the world." Lovelock's pro-nuke enthusiasm, unexpected from one of the mid-20th century's most ardent environmental thinkers, is the well-reasoned core of this urgent call for braking at the brink of global catastrophe. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Do your attempts to resolve differences with a controller leave you feeling wrung out and discouraged? Do you sense that your best traits (goodness, kindness, cooperation) somehow become a disadvantage with an overbearing counterpart? These questions and many more are addressed in the book, When Pleasing You Is Killing Me. With decades of experience as a psychotherapist, Dr. Les Carter takes you inside his counseling office, inviting you to share in real life stories of people just like you who are trying to make sense of persistent, controlling demands from all sorts of controlling people. A major premise explained by Dr. Carter is that every person has a built-in inclination to be controlling, but as maturation happens, controlling behaviors diminish. People pleasers are naturally positioned to increase their maturity since they are already predisposed to being loving, kind, and respectful. But when they routinely butt heads with controlling counterparts, their maturation is stunted as they predictably get pulled into power forms of communication that include coercion, shaming, accusations, defensiveness, anger, suppression, and the like.In the book, Dr. Carter will recount how real life pleasers developed relationship boundaries by incorporating assertiveness skills, ceasing unnecessary defensiveness, and setting aside false guilt for inner trust. Readers will be inspired to set their own pace in life, as opposed to letting the controller call the shots.</p><p>Dr. Les Carter has maintained a private counseling practice since 1980 when he affiliated with the Minirth-Meier Clinic in Richardson, Texas where he worked for 25 years. Since 2005 he has practiced at the Southlake Psychiatric and Counseling Center near Dallas, Texas.

Reviewers are simply agog over <i>Lord of the Silent, </i>calling it, &#x201c;Wonderfully entertaining&#x201d; (<i>Washington Times</i>), &#x201c;Deeply satisfying&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), and in the words of the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, &#x201c;The hype is true. This is Peters&#x2019;s best book.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Amelia Peabody Emerson is the Mary Poppins of Egypt. Forthright, intrepid, and industrious, she brooks no nonsense from anyone and is armed with an apparently magical parasol. As the legions of fans of Elizabeth Peters's Edwardian archeological mystery series know, Amelia is also possessed of a swift temper, an incorrigible curiosity, and an uncanny proclivity for attracting trouble. But in 1915, with the world gripped by the madness of war, trouble is endemic. In an effort to prevent their son Ramses from being coerced into working for British intelligence (in the sort of endeavor that nearly got him killed a year earlier when he infiltrated a band of Egyptian nationalists and prevented a Turkish-backed uprising), Amelia and husband Emerson and the rest of their dizzyingly large entourage flee England for the reassuringly stoic splendor of their beloved Egyptian ruins.<p> So much for a quiet dig among the mastabas. With their usual luck, the family promptly finds itself inundated by would-be assassins and nosy journalists. Amelia quickly deduces that Ramses's undercover work is at the root of both threat and curiosity; more puzzling is the appearance of the odd corpse or two and a rash of stunningly efficient tomb robberies. When Ramses and his wife, Nefret, travel to Luxor to check on the security of some of their old excavations, they find an all-too-familiar irritant behind the robberies. It would be telling to reveal his identity, but fans of the series will soon figure it out, with the aid of a little suspension of disbelief. With Ramses and Nefret on one hand, and Amelia and Emerson on the other, engaged in "protecting" the other side from conflict and trouble, the novel unfolds in a merry chase of misdirection and miscommunication.</p><p> There is a comforting consistency to Peters's series. By now, all of the characters' quirks are etched in stone like so many well-worn hieroglyphs. Amelia's narrative has the familiarity of a treasured and oft-read letter from a slightly batty aunt. Even the miraculous return of (no, I <i>really</i> can't say), though perhaps intended as a radical plot twist, adheres to the most genteel of mystery traditions, � la Doyle and Christie. Innovation can be overrated; with Peters's flawless record of producing amusing, easily digested novels showing no signs of faltering, fans should devour this morsel--and wait impatiently for the next tasty installment. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>Undeterred by world war and enemy submarines, Amelia Peabody --Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters's indomitable archaeologist-sleuth -- once again sets sail for Egypt, where ghosts of an ancient past and specters of a present-day evil hover silently over an inscrutable land.</p>Lord of the Silent<p></p><p>With son Ramses, his wife, Nefret, and a few unwelcome additions in tow, the elder Peabody-Emersons embark on a dangerous sea voyage to Alexandria, ultimately ending up in Cairo for their annual excavations. But in this autumn of 1915 the exotic, alluring city is not what it used to be. Cairo has been transformed into an armed camp teeming with enemy agents, and shockingly bold tomb robbers are brazenly desecrating the ancient sites.</p><p>Amelia's foremost priority is to prevent the War Office from pressing Ramses into service again, on the same sort of job that almost cost him his life the previous year. But in these terrible days of global conflict and relentless skullduggery, no place in Egypt is safe. Even remote Luxor provides no guarantee of safety, especially after Amelia discovers a fresh corpse resting in an ancient tomb.</p><p>The grim discovery presages further trouble for the Emersons, as the sinister conundrum pulls them all into a bubbling morass of corruption, intrigue, and international espionage deeper and more fiendish than any they have hitherto encountered. Death follows death, with abduction and an assault on Amelia herself intensifying the chaos of a world at war.</p><p>Yet there is an even darker danger in store for the Emersons. Can it be that one of Amelia's oldest and most dangerous adversaries will intervene to alter the family's destiny? Tantalizing clues suggest that this may be so and point toward an archaeological discovery of unparalleled importance -- and the resurrection of a voice that has been silent for millennia.</p></p><h2>America: Religions and Religion, 5th Edition</h2><p>Since its first publication in 1981, AMERICA: RELIGIONS AND RELIGION has become the standard introduction to the study of American religious traditions.

Jane always believed her father was dead--until she accidentally learned he was alive and well and living on Prince Edward Island. When Jane spends the summer at his cottage on Lantern Hill, doing all the wonderful things Grandmother deems unladylike, she dares to dream that there could be such a house back in Toronto...a house where she, Mother, and Father could live together without Grandmother directing their lives--a house that could be called home.</p><p>L. M. Montgomery was born in 1874 on Prince Edward Island, Canada, where she spent her childhood living with her grandparents in an old farmhouse. A prolific writer, she published many short stories, poems and novels, many of which were inspired by the years she spent on the beautiful Prince Edward Island. <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> and its sequels have always been amongst the most popular of children's classics. Montgomery died in Toronto in 1942 and was buried on her beloved island.<p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p> <p>Gay Street, so Jane always thought, did not live up to its name. It was, she felt certain, the most melancholy street in Toronto...though, to be sure, she had not seen a great many of the Toronto streets in her circumscribed comings and goings of eleven years.</p> <p>Gay Street should be a gay street, thought Jane, with gay, friendly houses, set amid flowers, that cried out, "How do you do?" to you as you passed them, with trees that waved hands at you and windows that winked at you in the twilights. Instead of that, Gay Street was dark and dingy, lined with forbidding, old-fashioned brick houses, grimy with age, whose tall, shuttered, blinded windows could never have thought of winking at anybody. The trees that lined Gay Street were so old and huge and stately that it was difficult to think of them as trees at all, any more than those forlorn little things in the green pails by the doors of the filling station on the opposite corner. Grandmother had been furious when the old Adams house on that corner had been torn down and the new white-and-red filling station built in its place. She would never let Frank get gas there. But at that, Jane thought, it was the only gay place on the street.</p> <p>Jane lived at 60 Gay. It was a huge, castellated structure of brick, with a pillared entrance porch, high, arched Georgian windows, and towers and turrets wherever a tower or turret could be wedged in. It was surrounded by a high iron fence with wrought-iron gates...those gates had been famous in the Toronto of an earlier day...that were always closed and locked by Frank at night, thus giving Jane a very nasty feeling that she was a prisoner being locked in.</p> <p>There was more space around 60 Gay than around most of the houses on the street. It had quite a bit of lawn in front, though the grass never grew well because of the row of old trees just inside the fence...and quite a respectable space between the side of the house and Bloor Street; but it was not nearly wide enough to dim the unceasing clatter and clang of Bloor, which was especially noisy and busy where Gay Street joined it. People wondered why old Mrs. Robert Kennedy continued to live there when she had oodles of money and could buy one of those lovely new houses in Forest Hill or in the Kingsway. The taxes on a lot as big as 60 Gay must be ruinous, and the house was hopelessly out of date. Mrs. Kennedy merely smiled contemptuously when things like this were said to her, even by her son, William Anderson, the only one of her first family whom she respected, because he had been successful in business and was rich in his own right. She had never loved him, but he had compelled her to respect him.</p> <p>Mrs. Kennedy was perfectly satisfied with 60 Gay. She had come there as the bride of Robert Kennedy when Gay Street was the last word in streets and 60 Gay, built by Robert's father, one of the finest "mansions" in Toronto. It had never ceased to be so in her eyes. She had lived there for forty-five years and she would live there the rest of her life. Those who did not like it need not stay there. This, with a satirically amused glance at Jane, who had never said she didn't like Gay Street. But grandmother, as Jane had long ago discovered, had an uncanny knack of reading your mind.</p> <p>Once, when Jane had been sitting in the Cadillac, one dark, dingy morning in a snowy world, waiting for Frank to take her to St. Agatha's, as he did every day, she had heard two women, who were standing on the street-corner, talking about it.</p> <p>"Did you ever see such a dead house?" said the younger. "It looks as if it had been dead for years."</p> <p>"That house died thirty years ago, when Robert Kennedy died," said the older woman. "Before that it was a lively place. Nobody in Toronto entertained more. Robert Kennedy liked social life. He was a very handsome, friendly man. People could never understand how he came to marry Mrs. James Anderson...a widow with three children. She was Victoria Moore to begin with, you know, old Colonel Moore's daughter...a very aristocratic family. But she was pretty as a picture then and was she crazy about him! My dear, she worshipped him. People said she was never willing to let him out of her sight for a moment. And they said she hadn't cared for her first husband at all. Robert Kennedy died when they had been married about fifteen years...died just after his first baby was born, I've heard."</p> <p>"Does she live all alone in that castle?"</p> <p>"Oh, no. Her two daughters live with her. One of them is a widow or something...and there's a granddaughter, I believe. They say old Mrs. Kennedy is a terrible tyrant, but the younger daughter...the widow...is gay enough and goes to everything you see reported in Saturday Evening. Very pretty...and can she dress! She was the Kennedy one and took after her father. She must hate having all her fine friends coming to Gay Street. It's worse than dead...it's decayed. But I can remember when Gay Street was one of the most fashionable residential streets in town. Look at it now."</p> <p>"Shabby genteel."</p> <p>"Hardly even that. Why, 58 Gay is a boarding-house. But old Mrs. Kennedy keeps 60 up very well, though the paint is beginning to peel off the balconies, you notice."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad I don't live on Gay Street," giggled the other, as they ran to catch the car.</p> <p>"You may well be," thought Jane. Though, if she had been put to it, she could hardly have told you where she would have liked to live if not at 60 Gay. Most of the streets through which she drove to St. Agatha's were mean and uninviting, for St. Agatha's, that very expensive and exclusive private school to which grandmother sent Jane, now found itself in an unfashionable and outgrown locality also. But St. Agatha's didn't mind that...St. Agatha's would have been St. Agatha's, you must understand, in the desert of Sahara.</p> <p>Uncle William Anderson's house in Forest Hill was very handsome, with landscaped lawns and rock gardens, but she wouldn't like to live there. One was almost terrified to walk over the lawn lest one do something to Uncle William's cherished velvet. You had to keep to the flat stepping-stones path. And Jane wanted to run. You couldn't run at St. Agatha's either, except when you were playing games. And Jane was not very good at games. She always felt awkward in them. At eleven she was as tall as most girls of thirteen. She towered above the girls of her class. They did not like it and it made Jane feel that she fitted in nowhere.</p> <p>As for running at 60 Gay...had anybody ever run at 60 Gay? Jane felt as if mother must have...mother stepped so lightly and gaily yet that you thought her feet had wings. But once, when Jane had dared to run from the front door to the back door, straight through the long house that was almost half the length of the city block, singing at the top of her voice, grandmother, who she had thought was out, had emerged from the breakfast-room and looked at her with the smile on her dead-white face that Jane hated.</p> <p>"What," she said in the silky voice that Jane hated still more, "is responsible for this outburst, Victoria?"</p> <p>"I was running just for the fun of it," explained Jane. It seemed so very simple. But grandmother had just smiled and said, as only grandmother could say things,</p> <p>"I wouldn't do it again if I were you, Victoria."</p> <p>Jane never did it again. That was the effect grandmother had on you, though she was so tiny and wrinkled...so tiny that lanky, long-legged Jane was almost as tall as she was.</p> <p>Jane hated to be called Victoria. Yet everybody called her that, except mother, who called her Jane Victoria. Jane knew somehow that grandmother resented that...knew that for some reason unknown to her, grandmother hated the name of Jane. Jane liked it...always had liked it...always thought of herself as Jane. She understood that she had been named Victoria after grandmother, but she did not know where the Jane had come from. There were no Janes in the Kennedys or Andersons. In her eleventh year she had begun to suspect that it might have come from the Stuart side. And Jane was sorry for that, because she did not want to think she owed her favorite name to her father. Jane hated her father in so far as hatred could find place in a little heart that was not made for hating anybody, even grandmother. There were times Jane was afraid she did hate grandmother, which was dreadful, because grandmother was feeding and clothing and educating her. Jane knew she ought to love grandmother, but it seemed a very hard thing to do. Apparently mother found it easy; but, then, grandmother loved mother, which made a difference. Loved her as she loved nobody else in the world. And grandmother did not love Jane. Jane had always known that. And Jane felt, if she did not yet know, that grandmother did not like mother loving her so much.</p> <p>"You fuss entirely too much about her," grandmother had once said contemptuously, when mother was worried about Jane's sore throat.</p> <p>"She's all I have," said mother.</p> <p>And then grandmother's old white face had flushed.</p> <p>"I am nothing, I suppose," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, mother, you know I didn't mean that," mother had said piteously, fluttering her hands in a way she had which always made Jane think of two little white butterflies. "I meant...I meant...she's my only child..."</p> <p>"And you love that child...his child...better than you love me!"</p> <p>"Not better...only differently," said mother pleadingly.</p> <p>"Ingrate!" said grandmother. It was only one word, but what venom she could put into a word. Then she had gone out of the room, still with that flush on her face and her pale blue eyes smoldering under her frosty hair.</p></p><h2>Embracing Brokenness: How God Refines Us Through Life&#39;s Disappointments</h2><p>Embracing Brokenness shows how a godly view of brokenness brings purpose and meaning to life&#x2019;s inevitable disappointments.</p><p>He loves me, He loves me not. When you encounter a painful event in your life-divorce, death of a family member, financial setback-you might wonder if God really loves you: "If He cares so much about me, why does He put me through times of suffering and brokenness?" Actually, God doesn&#x2019;t use tough times to punish you-He uses them to help you reach a level of spiritual maturity that cannot otherwise be reached. What feels uncomfortable now only makes you stronger and more beautiful down the road. In fact, God uses the breaking process out of love, hoping you&#x2019;ll respond to it in a way that brings you closer to Him. In Embracing Brokenness, Pastor Alan Nelson offers an encouraging look at the hopeful side of brokenness. Understanding the process of brokenness won&#x2019;t necessarily stop the hurting, but it will make the pain much more bearable. And you won&#x2019;t have to play the game of &#x201c;He loves me, He loves me not,&#x201d; because you&#x2019;ll clearly know the depth of God&#x2019;s love for you.Alan Nelson is the Executive Editor of Rev! Magazine, plus a 20-year veteran pastor, church planter, trainer, and student of leadership who is curious about impacting lives and the church. He has a doctorate (EdD) in leadership and is the author of a dozen books and over 100 articles.

For use by history career professionals.</p><p>Preface <p> As we enter the twenty-first century, the heritage of Western civilization is a major point of departure for understanding our own epoch. The unprecedented globalization of daily life has occurred in large measure through the spread of Western technological, economic, and political influences. From the sixteenth through the end of the twentieth century the West exerted vast influences throughout the globe for both good and ill, and the global citizens of this new century live in the wake of that impact. It is the goal of this book to introduce its readers to the Western heritage so that they may be better informed and more culturally sensitive citizens of the emerging global age. </p><p> Since The Western Heritage first appeared, we have sought to provide our readers with a work that does justice to the richness and variety of Western civilization. We hope that such an understanding of the West will foster lively debate on its character, values, institutions, and global influence. Indeed, we believe such a critical outlook on their own culture has characterized the peoples of the West since its earliest history. Through such debates we define ourselves and the values of our culture. Consequently, we welcome the debate and hope that The Western Heritage, seventh edition, can help to foster a genuinely informed discussion through its overview of Western civilization, its strengths, weaknesses, and the controversies surrounding it. </p><p> Human beings make, experience, and record their history. In this edition as in past editions, our goal has been to present Western civilization fairly, accurately, and in a way that does justice to that great variety of human enterprise. History has many facets, no one of which alone can account for the others. Any attempt to tell the story of the West from a single overarching perspective, no matter how timely, is bound to neglect or suppress some important part of that story. Like all authors, we have had to make selections for an introductory text, but we have attempted to provide the broadest possible coverage suitable to that task of introduction. To that end we hope that the vast array of documents included in this book will allow the widest possible spectrum of people over the course of the centuries to give personal voice to their experience and to allow our readers to enter into that experience. </p><p> We also believe that any book addressing the experience of the West must also look beyond its historical European borders. The students reading this book are drawn from a wide variety of cultures and experiences. They live in a world characterized by highly interconnected economies and instant communication between cultures. In this emerging multicultural society it seems both appropriate and necessary to recognize the ways in which Western civilization has throughout its history interacted with other cultures, influencing other societies and being influenced by them. Examples of this two-way interaction, such as that with Islam, appear throughout the text. To further highlight the theme of interaction, The Western Heritage includes a series of comparative essays, The West &amp; the World. (For a fuller description, see below.) Goals of the Text </p><p> Our primary goal has been to present a strong, clear narrative account of the central developments in Western history. We have also sought to call attention to certain critical themes:</p><p>The capacity of Western civilization from the time of the Greeks to the present to generate transforming self-criticism. The development of political freedom, constitutional government, and concern for the rule of law and individual rights. The shifting relations among religion, society, and the state. The development of science and technology and their expanding impact on thought, social institutions, and everyday life. The major religious and intellectual currents that have shaped Western culture. </p><p> We believe that these themes have been fundamental in Western civilization, shaping the past and exerting a continuing influence on the present. </p><p> FLEXIBLE PRESENTATION The Western Heritage, seventh edition, is designed to accommodate a variety of approaches to a course in Western civilization, allowing teachers to stress what is most important to them. Some teachers will ask students to read all the chapters. Others will select among them to re-enforce assigned readings and lectures. We have reorganized and rewritten the last two chapters (30 and 31) to permit instructors to end their course by emphasizing either social or political factors in the twentieth-century experience. </p><p> INTEGRATED SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND POLITICAL HISTORY The Western Heritage provides one of the richest accounts of the social history of the West available today, with strong coverage of family life, the changing roles of women, and the place of the family in relation to broader economic, political, and social developments. This coverage reflects the explosive growth in social historical research in the past quarter century, which has enriched virtually all areas of historical study. In this edition we have again expanded both the breadth and depth of our coverage of social history through revisions of existing chapters, the addition of major new material, and the inclusion of new documents. </p><p> While strongly believing in the study of the social experience of the West, we also share the conviction that internal and external political events have shaped the Western experience in fundamental and powerful ways. The experiences of Europeans in the twentieth century under fascism, national socialism, and communism demonstrate that influence, as has, more recently, the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. We have also been told repeatedly by teachers that no matter what their own historical specialization, they believe that a political narrative gives students an effective tool to begin to organize their understanding of the past. Consequently, we have made every effort to integrate the political with the social, cultural, and intellectual. </p><p> No other survey text presents so full an account of the religious and intellectual development of the West. People may be political and social beings, but they are also reasoning and spiritual beings. What they think and believe are among the most important things we can know about them. Their ideas about God, society, law, gender, human nature, and the physical world have changed over the centuries and continue to change. We cannot fully grasp our own approach to the world without understanding the intellectual currents of the past and their influence on our thoughts and conceptual categories. </p><p> CLARITY AND ACCESSIBILITY Good narrative history requires clear, vigorous prose. As in earlier editions, we have paid careful attention to the quality of our writing, subjecting every paragraph to critical scrutiny. Our goal was to make our presentation fully accessible to students without compromising vocabulary or conceptual level. We hope this effort will benefit both teachers and students.</p><p>Changes in the<br> Seventh Edition </p><p> INTRODUCING ART &amp; THE WEST A beautiful and important new feature enhances students' understanding of the artistic heritage of the West. In every chapter we highlight a work of art or architecture and discuss how the work illuminates and reflects the period in which it was created. In Chapter 5, for example, a portrait of a young woman on the wall of a house in Pompeii and the accompanying essay provide a glimpse into the life of well-to-do young women in the Roman Empire (p. 161). In Chapter 7, two views of Salisbury Cathedral illustrate an essay on Gothic architecture (p. 248). In Chapter 16, two paintings tell contrasting stories about domestic life in eighteenth-century France (p. 526), and in Part 4, works by Turner, Manet, and Seurat illustrate both the power of the new industrialism and its effects on European social life. Part 5 includes discussions of paintings by Grosz, Magritte, and Picasso. In Chapter 30, Bread, painted by the Soviet realist Tatjiana Yablonskaya, and Jackson Pollock's One (Number 31, 1950), offer starkly contrasting views of twentieth-century culture (p. 1040). (See p. xxiv for a complete list of Art &amp; The West essays.) </p><p> THE WEST &amp; THE WORLD In this feature, we focus on six subjects, comparing Western institutions with those of other parts of the world, or discussing the ways in which developments in the West have influenced cultures in other areas of the globe. In the seventh edition, the essays are:</p><p>Part 1: Ancient Warfare (new) (p. 186) Part 2: The Invention of Printing in China and Europe (new) (p. 284) Part 3: The Columbian Exchange (new) (p. 582) Part 4: The Abolition of Slavery in the Transatlantic Economy (p. 736) Part 5: Imperialism: Ancient and Modern (p. 928) Part 6: Energy and the Modern World (new) (p. 1116) </p><p> RECENT SCHOLARSHIP As in previous editions, changes in this edition reflect our determination to incorporate the most recent developments in historical scholarship and the concerns of professional historians. Of particular interest are expanded discussions of:</p><p>Women in the history of the West. Adding to our longstanding commitment to the inclusion of the experience of women in Western civilization, this edition presents new scholarship on women in the ancient world and the Middle Ages, women and the scientific revolution, and women under the authoritarian governments of the twentieth century. (See, especially, chapters 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 30. ) The Scientific Revolution. Chapter 14, which addresses the rise of the new science, has been wholly revised and rewritten to clarify the new scientific theory arising from the Copernican revolution, the new understanding of the Galileo case, the role of women in the new science, and the social institutions of the new science. The Dutch Golden Age. A new section in Chapter 15 discusses the United Netherlands during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Africa and the transatlantic economy. An extensive section in Chapter 17 explores the relationship of Africa to the transatlantic economy of the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. We examine the role of African society and politics in the slave trade, the experience of Africans forcibly transported to the Americas, and the incorporation of elements of African culture into the New World. Jewish thinkers in the Enlightenment. A new section in Chapter 18 discusses the thought of Spinoza and Moses Mendelsohn as they relate to the role of Jewish religion and society in the wider European culture. The Holocaust. The discussion of the Holocaust has been significantly expanded in two ways. Chapter 29 provides more analysis of the causes of the Holocaust, and Chapter 30 includes an extensive new narrative of the particular case of the destruction of the Jews of Poland. Twentieth-century social history. The seventh edition of The Western Heritage presents the most extensive treatment of twentieth-century social history available in a survey text. We examine, in Chapter 30, the experiences of women under authoritarian governments, the collectivization of Soviet agriculture, the destruction of the Polish Jewish community, and European migration. The chapter concludes with a new section on the coming of the computer and the impact of new technology on European life. The history of the Cold War and Europe at the start of the twenty-first century. Chapter 31, on the Soviet-American rivalry and the collapse of communism, has been wholly rewritten and includes the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Instructors may close their course with either of the twentieth-century chapters, depending on the issues they wish to emphasize. Chapter-by-Chapter Revisions </p><p> Chapter 1 The treatment of the origins of humankind has been completely rewritten to reflect the newest scholarship. </p><p> Chapters 3, 4, 5 contain new sections on Women in Homeric Society; Aspasia, Pericles' Common-law Wife; Greek Slavery; Women in Early Rome; Women of the Upper Classes in later Roman history. </p><p> Chapter 9 contains a discussion of medieval Russia. </p><p> Chapter 12 includes a shorter, rewritten discussion of The Thirty Years' War. </p><p> Chapter 14 has a wholly rewritten discussion of the Scientific Revolution and of the impact of the Scientific Revolution on philosophy, new or extensively rewritten sections on women and early modern science, the new institutions associated with the emerging scientific knowledge, religious faith and the new science, with an expanded discussion of the Galileo case. </p><p> Chapter 15 contains an extensive new section on the Dutch Golden Age, including the impact of its overseas empire on its prosperity. </p><p> Chapter 16 has a new section on The Impact of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions on Working Women. </p><p> Chapter 17 includes a much expanded and revised section on African Slavery, the experiences of Africans in the Americas, and the cultural institutions they brought with them. </p><p> Chapter 18 has a new section on Jewish Thinkers in the Age of Enlightenment with emphasis on Spinoza and Moses Mendelsohn. </p><p> Chapter 22 has a refocused discussion of Karl Marx's thought. </p><p> Chapter 25 expands the treatment of racial thinking and the non-Western world. </p><p> Chapter 28 includes a rewritten discussion of the Soviet Experience in the 1930s. </p><p> Chapter 29 expands the discussion of the Holocaust. </p><p> Chapter 30 is a largely new chapter on twentieth-century social history, with major new sections on state violence, women under authoritarian governments, the collectivization of Soviet agriculture, the destruction of the Polish Jews, and the impact of the computer. </p><p> Chapter 31 has been extensively rewritten and reorganized to reflect the latest scholarship on the Cold War through the collapse of communism. It ends with a discussion of Europe at the Opening of the Global Century. </p><p> The last two chapters are written so that instructors, though teaching both chapters, may choose to close their course with either, depending upon their personal emphasis. Those instructors wishing to emphasize social history might end the course with Chapter 30 and those wishing to emphasize political development and great power relations may choose to conclude with Chapter 31. </p><p> MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS To help students understand the relationship between geography and history, we have added relief features to approximately one-half of the maps. All 90 maps have been carefully edited for accuracy. The text also contains close to 500 color and black and white illustrations, many of them new to the seventh edition. </p><p> PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES This edition retains the pedagogical features of the last edition, including part-opening comparative timelines, a list of key topics at the beginning of each chapter, chapter review questions, and questions accompanying the more than 200 source documents in the text.

Budd&#x2019;s well-received and award-winning presentation shows labor relations as a system for balancing employment relationship goals (efficiency, equity, and voice) and the rights of labor and management. Labor Relations moves beyond a process-based focus in studying this topic by placing the discussion of contemporary U.S. processes into the context of underlying themes, such as what the goals of the system are, whether or not those goals are being fulfilled, and if reform is needed. Central topics are placed in the broader context of the goals of the employment relationship, conflicting rights, and the environment of the 21st century. Budd&#x2019;s broader context, therefore, makes labor relations more engaging and relevant to students. It also allows instructors to raise important &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; ideas that go beyond mere how-to descriptions of labor relations.</p><p>John W. Budd is a professor in the Industrial Relations Center at the University of Minnesota&#x2019;s Carlson School of Management where he holds an Industrial Relations Landgrant Professorship.

In the preparation of the Second Edition, we have made good use of this valuable feedback.

Chapter topics reflect issues of interest and concern to today's college and university students, providing students with many opportunities to make connections with topics they're discussing in other courses.

Active, personalized, and real communication about actual issues and experiences is at the heart of <b><i>Conexiones.</i></b> </p> <p><b>Sequence and Organization of Structure Review</b></p> <p> The sequence and organization of the review and presentation of Spanish grammatical structures in <b><i>Conexiones</i></b> is motivated by concerns expressed by instructors from around the country. The concern we share is that the grammar sequence in most Intermediate Spanish programs places verbal moods and tenses presented in the second half of introductory courses also in the second half of intermediate texts. This repetition of a first-year sequence results in students progressing to advanced levels without a thorough understanding of the indicative and subjunctive moods and without a concrete grounding in the forms and usage of certain tenses. Even worse, students who do not study beyond the intermediate level leave their typical four-semester study of Spanish with little more than first-year competence. </p> <p> <b><i>Conexiones</i></b> offers an alternative. It begins with a preliminary <i>Lecci�n</i> that reacquaints students with the Spanish they have already learned and prepares them for the transition to a higher level. Students discuss their interests and goals, and how Spanish will fit into their future. Then, <i>Lecci�n</i> 1 reviews the preterit and imperfect tenses, equipping students to shift back and forth naturally between the present and the past as they speak, read, and write throughout the course. The review of the present subjunctive begins in <i>Lecci�n</i> 2; students are exposed to and use the subjunctive mood alongside the indicative all through the program, refining their understanding of both the concept and usage of mood&#x2014;essential to Spanish and other languages&#x2014;throughout the intermediate level of study. This approach results in a classroom language environment that reflects the way in which Spanish is spoken by millions of people around the world and in which students are increasingly likely to experience it at home in the United States and Canada. </p> <p><b>Highlights of the Second Edition</b></p> <p> <b><i>Scope and sequence.</i></b> With the idea of achieving a more functional and even distribution, the following additions and changes have been made: </p> <p> <b><i>Lecci�n preliminar.</i></b> A new warm-up chapter helps prepare students for intermediate-level Spanish. This chapter serves as a bridge between the elementary and the intermediate levels in terms of theme (<i>�Hagamos conexiones!</i>), vocabulary, and grammar. </p> <p> <b><i>Lecci�n 1.</i></b> As suggested by our users, we have chosen a chapter theme of storytelling, a topic that will appeal to everyone and can be easily discussed. </p> <p> <b><i>�As� es la vida!</i></b> Several of the chapter-opening language samples have been updated to make them more relevant to today's students. </p> <p> <b><i>�As� lo decimos!</i></b> Vocabulary lists have been revised and shortened. </p> <p> <b><i>Aplicaci�n.</i></b> We have revised, changed, and updated activities, and sequenced them to ensure that students will have an opportunity to practice forms before using them creatively. For example, the new activity, <i>En familia,</i> gives students the opportunity to expand their vocabulary and use it creatively. </p> <p> <b><i>A escuchar.</i></b> Each <i>lecci�n</i> now has two <i>A escuchar</i> listening activities to increase balance among the four skills; the <i>A escuchar</i> activities appear at the end of each chapter part. </p> <p> <b><i>Ritmos.</i></b> We have included six new songs, which are thematically and grammatically related to the chapter. </p> <p> <b><i>P�ginas.</i></b> Three new literary selections have been added, and others have been edited to make them more accessible to intermediate students. </p> <p> <b><i>Im�genes.</i></b> Two new and exciting paintings have been added. </p> <p> <b><i>�A explorar!</i></b> Web activities have been added to each chapter to encourage Students to further explore the topics presented in each lesson. Each lesson has five <i>A explorar</i> activities. Weblinks to support the <i>�A explorar!</i> activities are provided on the <b><i>Conexiones</i></b> Website (<b>www.prenhall.com/conexiones</b>). </p> <p> <b><i>Conexiones</i> Website.</b> The Website has been updated to include new activities and weblinks. Students may practice the vocabulary and grammar of each chapter through activities that provide instant grading. Guided Web activities offer opportunities to further explore the chapter topic and the cultural materials presented in <i>Ritmos, Im�genes,</i> and <i>P�ginas.</i> </p> <p> <b><i>Video program.</i></b> The video program has been updated to include more engaging and authentic clips from Spain and Latin America. Each videoclip addresses the theme presented in each chapter, providing authentic listening practice and a basis for class discussion. Activities based on the videoclips, along with the video transcript are included in the Video Manual. </p> <p><b>Chapter Organization and Pedagogy</b></p> <p> Written entirely in Spanish with the exception of grammar review explanations, the Second Edition of <b><i>Conexiones</i></b> consists of a <i>Lecci�n preliminar,</i> followed by twelve lecciones. Each of the twelve <i>lecciones</i> is divided into three parts: <i>Primera parte, Segunda parte,</i> and <i>�As� lo expresamos!</i> Each <i>parte</i> maintains the following consistent structure: </p> <p> <b><i>�As� es la vida!</i></b> A variety of language models (newspaper and magazine articles, interviews, dialogues, letters, illustrations, advertisements, and other types of realia) set the stage for the assimilation of communicative functions, previewing vocabulary presented and grammatical structures reviewed in the <i>lecci�n,</i> and providing relevant, interesting content and cultural information. Very rich in content, <i>�As� es la vida!</i> is not merely a language sample; it is a forum where students discover new things about the world around them from a Hispanic perspective. </p> <p> <b><i>�As� lo decimos!</i></b> A thematically organized presentation of words and expressions follows the chapter-opening language sample. First, <i>Vocabulario primordial</i> provides a list of review vocabulary related to the chapter theme. These cognates and words with which students should be familiar at the second-year level are presented without English translation. <i>Vocabulario clave</i> then presents new words and expressions relevant to the chapter's theme, drawing heavily on <i>�As� es la vida!</i> New items are organized by part of speech and presented with their English equivalents. Finally, <i>Ampliaci�n</i> provides an opportunity to learn patterns of noun, verb, and adjective formation using familiar words and new items presented immediately before. Following many of the <i>�As� lo decimos!</i> vocabulary lists, a section called <i>�Cuidado!</i> presents tricky cognates, discusses differences in usage between Spanish and English, and alerts students to false cognates and groups of words such as <i>salvar, guardar,</i> and <i>ahorrar</i> that all have a single equivalent word in English. <i>Aplicaci�n</i> activities that follow the vocabulary presentation provide a global orientation to the chapter topic and give students the opportunity to use the new vocabulary in meaningful and communicative contexts. These activities have been carefully designed so that they range from guided to communicative. </p> <p> <b><i>Estructuras.</i></b> Grammar explanations are clear and concise with examples closely related to the chapter topic, reviewing and expanding upon explanations found in introductory texts. Important points are illustrated with art and realia, and abundant practice opportunities range from contextualized and meaningful form practice to a variety of personalized and communicative exercises and activities. A special section in the accompanying Workbook reviews very basic first-year material, allowing for appropriate coverage of more complex points in the main text. Students can use this special Workbook review section on their own, or instructors can suggest specific exercises for students who may need guided review. </p> <p> <b><i>Comparaciones.</i></b> Each <i>lecci�n</i> in <b><i>Conexiones</i></b> highlights and explores aspects of Hispanic culture in terms of customs and traditions, history, and daily life in brief topical discussions. Students compare what they learn about...</p></p><h2>Architectural Drawing And Light Construction</h2><p>This new edition of Architectural Drawing and Light Construction, a classic in the field, has been updated to include new methods, materials, and media. This text serves as an excellent introduction to the fields of architectural drawing and construction. It covers drafting and drawing principles, light frame construction principles, and the building design documentation process. The text covers both manual drawing techniques and the use of computer-aided design and drafting software to create drawings. The text presents the concepts with easy-to-follow text and numerous illustrations to highlight and provide examples of key concepts. Other features of this text include: *Review questions and exercises that allow students to apply both the theory and the skills presented in the text. *CADD boxes that highlight the use of design and drafting software to create drawings. *Updates of examples, standards, and methods that reflect current industry standards and practices. *Examples and drawings from the field to reinforce the application of the concepts to real-world situations.</p><p>The most current information on architectural drawing and residential design, delineation, detailing and specification writing, residential planning, and light-frame construction is covered in this thorough revision. From clear, concise explanations of drafting and design fundamentals to the latest equipment and techniques--the material is continuously bolstered with troubleshooting tips, illustrations, and guidelines. The fourth edition retains many of the original hand illustrations to express the quality and character possible in architectural drawing techniques. To keep pace with current trends, computer-aided design and drafting have been introduced for the first time.<p> The seventh edition of <i>Architectural Drawing and Light Construction</i> updates material from the previous editions with no major changes to the basic organization. Chapters have been updated to include information from the latest building codes and material suppliers. I have also included information on the safe use of drafting and other equipment in the lab. </p> <p> The text retains its basic approach to teaching drafting based on concepts taught for years in manual drafting courses, even though the use of CAD is now widespread in all drafting fields. In an attempt to provide more consistency, I have standardized fonts in graphics wherever possible and updated many graphics as CAD files where appropriate. My goal has been to combine the best of the existing manually drafted graphics with new computer-generated graphics. </p> <p> Instructors are strongly encouraged to use the Instructor's Manual developed in conjunction with this text. This manual has been updated to address areas of student safety in the lab and student behavior as it relates to safety and cooperation. I have included examples of some of the strategies I use in my program to deal with these issues. The manual retains solutions for all the exercises in the text along with a discussion of how the text can be used in a two-year associate degree program of study. Outlines of course syllabi are included to show how lab lectures and assignments correlate with textbook chapters. In addition, there are a number of items instructors may find useful as student handouts or as masters for overhead transparencies. </p></p><h2>Workbook/Lab Manual to accompany Deux mondes: A Communicative Approach</h2><p>This combined workbook/laboratory manual contains both acquisition activities and learning exercises for use outside the classroom and includes an answer key in the back of the book.</p><p>Tracy D.

How can a physical brain create our experience of the world? What creates our identity? Do we really have free will? Could consciousness itself be an illusion? Exciting new developments in brain science are opening up these debates, and the field has now expanded to include biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers. This book clarifies the potentially confusing arguments and clearly describes the major theories, with illustrations and lively cartoons to help explain the experiments. Topics include vision and attention, theories of self, experiments on action and awareness, altered states of consciousness, and the effects of brain damage and drugs. This lively, engaging, and authoritative book provides a clear overview of the subject that combines the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience--and serves as a much-needed launch pad for further exploration of this complicated and unsolved issue.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Thoughtful and nuanced, lively and highly readable, this annotated Constitution is for all of us to read and refer to&#x2014;the ultimate political fact-checking source for every American.</p><p>Ray Raphael&#x2019;s ten books on the Founding Era include <i>A People&#x2019;s History of the American Revolution</i> (2001), <i>Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past</i> (2004), <i>Mr. President: How and Why the Founders Created a Chief Executive</i> (2012), and <i>Constitutional Myths</i> (2013).

He lives in Northern California.<b>from the Introduction </b><br><br>In the United States, the Constitution&#x2014;not the president, nor any elected leader&#x2014;reigns supreme. Article VI declares succinctly: &#x201c;This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof,...shall be the supreme Law of the Land.&#x201d; Americans for more than two centuries have treated the primacy of the Constitution as gospel, and that is no small part of our endurance as a nation. &#x201c;Regime change&#x201d; in the United States proceeds peacefully. One president passes the torch to the next, even if the two belong to opposing political parties. Representatives and senators come and go, but the Constitution provides the framework under which they all must govern.<br><br> Yet the passage of time does present interpretive problems. We have agreed to abide by rules developed in a very different age. If we are to understand the historical Constitution and allow it to guide us today, we need to take account of the differences between then and now.<br><br> The framers&#x2019; concerns were not identical to ours. The Constitution stipulates that Congress has the authority to &#x201c;grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal&#x201d; and &#x201c;punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high seas,&#x201d; but we worry more about terrorists on airplanes than pirates on the high seas. How can we balance airport security with privacy concerns? It would be odd to treat the framers as experts in such matters. We might look to basic principles that they espoused, but the devil is in the details and details are markedly absent.<br><br> Textual interpretation of the Constitution must account for the evolution of language. Article VI guarantees that the federal government will protect against &#x201c;domestic Violence.&#x201d; Today the term refers to spousal abuse, but back then it meant civil unrest. Constitutionese is not our native tongue.<br><br> To grasp the context in which our Constitution was drafted, imagine that it is the spring of 1787. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress depends on the states for funds, but from October 1786 through March 1787, the states have paid a grand total of $663 into the federal treasury. To use a modern idiom, the federal government has shrunk to the size where it can drown in a bathtub. Penniless and powerless, Congress cannot even muster a quorum.<br><br> The state of Massachusetts has asked Congress to suppress a rebellion (&#x201c;domestic Violence&#x201d;) of indebted farmers who are closing the courts, but there is no federal army to speak of, only a few hundred soldiers stationed in western forts. Debtors are closing courts in South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey as well. In Pennsylvania, farmers are preventing tax collectors from seizing their cattle. The Rhode Island legislature, under the sway of debtors, has just issued paper money. New York, North Carolina, and Georgia are now debating whether to follow Rhode Island&#x2019;s lead. All of this is destroying public credit. With the value of money plummeting, neither Congress nor the states can find willing lenders.<br><br> What is to be done? Obviously, the Articles of Confederation&#x2014;the nation&#x2019;s existing constitution&#x2014;need to be fixed. Twelve states (but not Rhode Island) send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia &#x201c;for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation&#x201d; to &#x201c;render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government &amp; the preservation of the Union.&#x201d; But will &#x201c;revising&#x201d; the Articles suffice? That document requires unanimous approval for any amendments, a hurdle that has proved impossible to clear. Two amendments granting Congress the power to lay imposts have already failed.<br><br> On the first day of deliberations, Virginia&#x2019;s Edmund Randolph and Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Gouverneur Morris move that instead of merely &#x201c;correcting and enlarging&#x201d; the Articles of Confederation, &#x201c;a <i>national</i> government ought to be established consisting of a <i>supreme</i> legislative, executive &amp; judiciary.&#x201d; (James Madison&#x2019;s meticulous notes on the convention emphasized the words &#x201c;national&#x201d; and &#x201c;supreme.&#x201d;) Would delegates vote for it despite their instructions only to revise the Articles of Confederation? <br><br> They did, and that was a defining moment. The framers wanted to create from scratch an &#x201c;energetic&#x201d; government with sufficient &#x201c;vigor&#x201d; (among their favorite words) to prevent the United States from collapsing as a nation. A writer in <i>The</i> <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i> put it this way: &#x201c;The Year 1776 is celebrated for a revolution in favor of <i>Liberty</i>. The year 1787, it is expected, will be celebrated with equal joy, for a revolution in favor of <i>Government</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>What would that government look like?<br><br> The framers wanted it to be robust yet not tyrannical. To balance strength and restraint, they created three distinct branches that could constrain one another. &#x201c;Separation of powers&#x201d; and &#x201c;checks and balances&#x201d; are often said to limit federal power, but in fact, they serve the opposite purpose. By distributing authority to different components <i>within</i> the federal government, the framers gave that government <i>greater</i> powers than it dared grant to a single body. As protections grew, they could add more powers&#x2014;that was the framers&#x2019; basic strategy and crowning achievement.</p><h2>Workbook for the Identification of Phonological Processes and Distinctive Features</h2><p>Workbook for the Identification of Phonological Processes and Distinctive Features [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>The Brain Power Classroom: 10 Essentials for Focus, Mindfulness, and Emotional Wellness</h2><p>Create a Focused, Positive, and Engaged Classroom!<br><br>Through expert guidance and inspiring stories from the field, Dave Beal helps you create a Brain Power Classroom full of engaged, focused and collaborative students.<br><br>Part 1 provides scientific background, principles and insightful advice for creating an optimal classroom atmosphere.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price.

Young Nonesuch, seeing his proud family wiped out by brutish humans during the Wars of the Roses, shrinks down to the size of a large insect to escape notice and sets out to learn more about people, and to find treasureas his grandmother always said, ``a dragon without a treasure is nothing but an ugly flying reptile.'' Something draws him to a gloriously-illustrated Book of Hours, and he accompanies it on its bumpy journey through the centuries. It comes to rest at last in the back room of a quiet bookstore on this side of the Atlantic, and Nonesuch guards it there still; a small, ferocious presence, seldom seen but comforting nonetheless. Plenty of lively characters help animate this rather leisurely story, from Lopped Cedric the one-legged bandit to the nameless rat who teaches Nonesuch to read and Abercrombie, the suave, ruthless real estate developer who learns that dragon justice is sudden and simple. Historiated initials and occasional small, sprightly drawings in the text and margins give the book a slightly antique look. As with Kushner's other books, this treasure house of dragon lore will appeal most to patient readers. John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This new novel by the author of award-winning The Violin Maker and Uncle Jacob's Ghost Story follows the life of a dragon, Nonesuch, from his birth during the Dark Ages up until the present day. Nonesuch survives the changes of history (the War of the Roses, the great fire of London, etc.) by becoming as small as a large insect. He forsakes his family treasure of goldthough his dragon nature demands that he guard somethingand finds treasure of his own: a Book of Hours lovingly illuminated by a monk during Nonesuch's youth near the end of the Middle Ages. He learns to read from a rat during the Black Plague. Centuries later, Nonesuch and his book are in the New World. How he becomes enmeshed in human affairs is at the center of Kushner's quiet, intelligent book. His matter-of-fact treatment of history and philosophical discussions makes this a thought-provoking work.

Stringer's new theory, based on archeological and genetic evidence, holds that distinct humans coexisted and competed across the African continent&#x2015;exchanging genes, tools, and behavioral strategies.</p><p>Stringer draws on analyses of old and new fossils from around the world, DNA studies of Neanderthals (using the full genome map) and other species, and recent archeological digs to unveil his new theory. He shows how the most sensational recent fossil findings fit with his model, and he questions previous concepts (including his own) of modernity and how it evolved. </p><p><i>Lone Survivors</i> will be the definitive account of who and what we were, and will change perceptions about our origins and about what it means to be human.</p></p><p><b>Chris Stringer</b> is the author of <i>The Complete World of Human Evolution</i>, <i>Homo britannicus</i>, and more than two hundred books and papers on the subject of human evolution. One of the world's foremost paleoanthropologists, he is a researcher at the Natural History Museum in London and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He has three children and lives in Sussex and London.1<br><br>The Big Questions<br>&nbsp;<br><br>It is barely 150 years since Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace presented their ideas on evolution to the world. A year later, in 1859, Darwin was to publish one of the most famous of all books, <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. Then, the first fossil human finds were only beginning to be recognized, and paleontology and archaeology were still in their infancy. Now, there is a rich and ever-growing record from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and I have been privileged to work in one of the most exciting eras for discoveries about our origins. There have been highly significant fossil finds, of course, but there have also been remarkable scientific breakthroughs in the amount of information we can extract from those finds. In this first chapter I will outline the evidence that has been used to reconstruct where our species originated, and the very different views that have developed, including my own. There are in fact two origins for modern human features that we need to consider. Here, I will talk about our species in terms of the physical features we humans share today, for example, a slender skeleton compared to our more robust predecessors, a higher and rounder braincase, smaller brow ridges, and a prominent chin. But there are also the characteristics that distinguish different geographic populations today&#x2014;the regional or &#x201c;racial&#x201d; characteristics, such as the more projecting nose of many Europeans, or the flatter face of most Orientals. I will discuss their quite different origins later in the book.<br>In <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871), Darwin suggested that Africa was the most likely evolutionary homeland for humans because it was the continent where our closest relatives, the African apes, could be found today. However, it was to be many years before the fossil evidence that was ultimately to prove him right began to be discovered. Before then, Europe with the Neanderthals, &#x201c;Heidelberg Man,&#x201d; and the spurious &#x201c;Piltdown Man,&#x201d; and Asia with &#x201c;Java Man,&#x201d; were the foci of scientific attention concerning human ancestry. But the 1921 discovery of the Broken Hill skull in what is now Zambia, and the 1924 discovery of the Taung skull (from South Africa), started the process that gave Africa its paramount importance in the story of human evolution, even if that process still had many years to run. By the 1970s a succession of fossils had established that Africa not only was the place of origin for the human line (that is, the continent in which the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived) but was probably also where the genus <i>Homo</i> (humans) had originated. But where did our own species, <i>Homo sapiens</i> (modern humans), originate? This was still unclear in the 1970s and remained so until quite recently.<br>When Charles Darwin wrote in the <i>Origin of Species</i>, &#x201c;light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history,&#x201d; he was reluctant to say any more on the subject, as he admitted twelve years later in the introduction to <i>The Descent of Man</i>: &#x201c;During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views.&#x201d; But in the intervening years he had been fortified by a growing number of influential supporters and thus felt ready&#x2014;finally&#x2014;to tackle the controversial topic of human origins. He then went on to say: &#x201c;The sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some pre-existing form; secondly, the manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man.&#x201d; However, Darwin acknowledged that there were still many doubters, something that unfortunately remains as true today as it was then: &#x201c;It has often and confidently been asserted, that man&#x2019;s origin can never be known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.&#x201d;<br>Darwin then proceeded to pay tribute to a number of other scientists for their work on human origins, particularly the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and this is especially interesting as Haeckel differed from him and Thomas Huxley (&#x201c;Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog&#x201d;) over a critical question about our origins, a question that continues to be debated even today. In <i>The Descent of Man</i> Darwin wrote: &#x201c;We are naturally led to enquire, where was the birthplace of man at that stage of descent when our progenitors diverged from the catarrhine stock [the catarrhines group includes apes and monkeys]?... In each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It is therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee; and as these two species are now man&#x2019;s nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.&#x201d; However, he then proceeded to caution, &#x201c;But it is useless to speculate on this subject&nbsp;... as there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale.&#x201d;<br>Not only did Darwin have to deal with a dearth of fossil evidence in 1871, including a complete absence of any humanlike fossils from Africa, but there was also no knowledge of the concept of continental drift (the idea that landmasses migrated in the past, splitting and realigning as they moved across the Earth&#x2019;s surface). This process is now known to underlie many of the present distributions of plants and animals (for example, the unique assemblages of species found in places like Australia and New Zealand). Previously, to explain puzzling links between species in different regions, now-sunken continents were often postulated. For example, lemurs are rather primitive primates that today are found only on the island of Madagascar, some three hundred miles off the coast of Africa, but ancient lemurlike fossils had been found in the Indian subcontinent, and such similarities led the British zoologist Philip Sclater to hypothesize in 1864 that there was once a large continent, which he named Lemuria, stretching across much of what is now the Indian Ocean.<br>Using the concept of this lost continent, Haeckel argued for a different ancestral homeland for humans: &#x201c;There are a number of circumstances which suggest that the primeval home of man was a continent now sunk below the surface of the Indian Ocean, which extended along the south of Asia&nbsp;... towards the east; towards the west as far as Madagascar and the southeastern shores of Africa. By assuming this Lemuria to have been man&#x2019;s primeval home, we greatly facilitate the explanation of the geographical distribution of the human species by migration.&#x201d; Moreover, Haeckel differed from Darwin and Huxley in favoring the gibbon and orangutan of southeast Asia as better ape models for human ancestry than the gorilla and chimpanzee of Africa. And whereas Darwin followed the geologist Charles Lyell in arguing that the fossil record of human evolution was still unknown because the right regions had not yet been searched (in particular Africa), Haeckel preferred the explanation that most of the critical evidence was now sunk beneath the Indian Ocean.<br>Eug�ne Dubois and his &#x201c;<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>&#x201d; skull.<br>During Darwin&#x2019;s lifetime, the Neanderthals were already known from their fossil remains as ancient inhabitants of Europe. While some scientists pushed them into the position of &#x201c;missing links,&#x201d; reconstructing them with bent knees and grasping big toes, others like Huxley recognized them as big-brained, upright, and unmistakably human. Darwin never lived to see the first discovery of a really primitive human fossil, announced by a Dutch doctor, Eug�ne Dubois, in 1891. Dubois had been inspired by Haeckel&#x2019;s writings to get an army posting to what was then the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), to search for ancient remains. Haeckel had created the name &#x201c;<i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>&#x201d; (&#x201c;Ape Man without Speech&#x201d;) for a hypothetical link between apes and humans that he believed had once lived in Lemuria. Dubois was blessed with luck in his excavations on the island of Java and soon found a fossilized and apelike skullcap and a human-looking thighbone. He named these &#x201c;<i>Pithecanthropus</i>&#x201d; (in honor of Haeckel) &#x201c;<i>erectus</i>&#x201d; (because the femur indicated this creature walked upright, as we do). We now know this species as <i>Homo erectus</i>, a wide-ranging and long-lived species of early human. But because this first find of the species was made on the Indonesian island of Java, it tended to reinforce Haeckel&#x2019;s and Dubois&#x2019;s notions of a Lemurian/southern Asian origin for humans, rather than an African one.<br>In naming &#x201c;<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>,&#x201d; Dubois was following the system laid down over a century earlier by that greatest of all classifiers, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. The Chinese sage Confucius said that it was &#x201c;a wise man&#x201d; who specified the names of things, and by happy coincidence this was the name, in Latin, that Linnaeus chose for the human species: <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Before Linnaeus there were many different ways of naming and grouping plants and animals, often based at random on particular features that they showed&#x2014;color, say, how they moved around, or what they ate. But Linnaeus believed in grouping living things by the bodily features they shared, and at the heart of his system were the two names applied to every natural kind, or species: its group or genus name capitalized, and its particular species name. Thus <i>Homo</i> (&#x201c;Man&#x201d;) and <i>sapi...</i></p><h2>B-Boy Blues (A B-Boy Blues Novel #1)</h2><p>Hardy's debut novel about the lives of black gay men in New York City is unabashedly and unapologetically written for the African-American male. Rough, sexy, humorous, and authentic, <i>B-Boy Blues</i> is a first-rate love story.</p><p>A professional man's involvement with rough trade (a socially inferior, potentially dangerous sex partner) underscores the precarious position of gay black men in a hostile world in this, a lusty, freewheeling first novel from a young African-American journalist. Mitchell Crawford meets Raheim Rivers in a gay bar in Greenwich Village in the summer of 1993. Mitchell is a 27-year-old journalist; Raheim is a 21-year-old bicycle messenger and B-boy (banjee boy). The B-boy hangs out on street corners, cool and menacing. ``I find them irresistible,'' confesses Mitchell. Raheim is the third B-boy in his life, and the charm. Their smoking-hot sex (described with the verve of a master pornographer) develops into strong mutual need as Mitchell discovers that underneath his tough exterior, Raheim is smart, talented (he can draw to professional standards), and a loving parent to his five-year-old son. The snag is Raheim's violent streak. When Mitchell nudges him to accept his homosexuality, Raheim almost knocks him out before fleeing. Violence is an inescapable part of their world. Raheim's best friend is gunned down in the street, Mitchell's best friend becomes a victim of gay-bashing. While Mitchell is angered by the homophobia among blacks that encourages such attacks, he reserves his harshest words for white people, gay as well as straight, who continue to exploit black Americans and deny them a level playing field (he quits his magazine when a less qualified white co-worker gets a coveted promotion). Meanwhile Hardy, hell-bent on a happy ending, has Raheim and Mitchell make up and declare their love. We miss the cold artist's eye that had earlier seen the impossibility of such a union. Elsewhere Hardy's eye does not fail him. Though his characters need work (Raheim is the generic B-boy, Mitchell simply the sum of his opinions), his anger is impressive; Hardy has the makings of a formidable talent. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Mitchell Crawford's fantasy has always been to have a B-boy. For him, B-boys stand on street corners daring anyone to invade their territory, dress to thrill, move to a rhythm all their own, and, loud and boisterous, "speak to be heard, not so much to be understood." Now, you don't think of any tough black street boy as being gay, don't often read about very different segments of the black community in contact with one another, and, if you're white, don't often encounter black narrators who honestly tell how they feel about whites. You do here. Mitchell is young, black, educated, and gay. He works on a magazine, lives in a nice Manhattan apartment, and runs around with a group of men like himself. He has flings with two other B-boys, then meets Raheim, the man of his dreams in this first-rate love story. Supporting characters--Raheim's son and Mitchell's family and work friends--add to the plot and the realism as Hardy reveals much about what happens when two cultures meet and more about diversity than you get from most diversity workshops. Highly recommended for both gay- and black-literature collections. <i>Charles Harmon</i></p><h2>Burn Factor</h2><p><p>Bestselling novelist Kyle Mills took the nation by storm with his stunning debut thriller, <em>Rising Phoenix,</em> a powerful tale of intrigue and suspense that introduced maverick FBI agent Mark Beamon. Frederick Forsyth raved, "In the world of political thrillers, I have the feeling that young Kyle Mills will soon be a very big player." Now Kyle Mills returns with his most riveting story yet, an edge-of-the-seat drama featuring a new star -- female FBI employee Quinn Barry.</p><p> Bright, young, and ambitious, Quinn Barry desperately wants to be an FBI agent. Right now, though, she's just a low-level employee toiling in the basement at Quantico. But Quinn's career -- and her life -- are about to change wildly. Testing her new database program, Quinn turns up a mysterious DNA link among five gruesome murders. A link that the old FBI computer system had been carefully programmed to miss. The discovery lands her a demotion to the hinterlands, followed by a series of unfortunate "accidents" that nearly end her life. </p><p>Pitted against a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions, Quinn is determined to uncover what someone very powerful wants to keep hidden -- dark, dirty secrets involving high levels of government. She turns for help to her boyfriend, an ambitious young CIA agent, only to flee to protect herself and, she hopes, him. Finally an ally emerges from teh most unlikely place of all, and with his help Quinn will at last turn the tables on her shadowy assailants -- and land herself in the clutches of a sadistic, brilliant madman who holds the key to it all.</p><p>Bristling with the galvanizing suspense and hair-trigger action that Kyle Mills's fans have come to expect, <em>Burn Factor</em> is certain to carve another notch in bestseller lists nationwide.</p></p><p>Why would the FBI want to cover up a link between five unsolved murders, especially a link as telling as matching DNA recovered from every one of the crime scenes? That's the premise of Kyle Mills's <i>Burn Factor</i>. Instead of his usual hero, FBI agent Mark Beamon, the author introduces Quinn Barry, a relatively low-level analyst for the agency who stumbles across what at first looks like a glitch in the computer's forensics program. But of course it's not--the serial killer protected by the powers that be is a truly mad scientist who's indispensable to the completion of a top-secret weapons project. Quinn, whose lifelong ambition is to move up in the ranks and become a full-fledged FBI agent, is transferred out of her programming job as soon as she brings the link to the attention of superiors. But the plucky woman ignores their warnings and enlists the aid of another scientific genius, who also happens to be the chief suspect in at least one of the gruesome murders she's intent on solving. <p> <i>Burn Factor</i> is big on implausible and illogical plot twists, and small on characterizations. We never learn enough about Quinn to understand why she puts her career (not to mention her life) in jeopardy, even as evidence of a massive cover-up continues to mount and her boyfriend, a CIA agent, turns out to be a willing accomplice to the conspirator-in-chief. Fans of Mills's previous novels (<i>Rising Phoenix</i>, <i>Storming Heaven</i>, <i>Free Fall</i>) who keep waiting for Beamon to show up and save the day will be disappointed, especially since the author doesn't quite succeed in making Quinn Barry as appealing a protagonist. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>10 cds</p><h2>Brave Genius: A Scientist, a Philosopher, and Their Daring Adventures from the French Resistance to the Nobel Prize</h2><p><b>The never-before-told account of the intersection of&nbsp;some of the most insightful minds of the 20th century, and a fascinating look at how war, resistance, and friendship can catalyze genius.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In the spring of 1940, the aspiring but unknown writer Albert Camus and budding scientist Jacques Monod were quietly pursuing ordinary, separate lives in Paris. After the German invasion and occupation of France, each joined the Resistance to help liberate the country from the Nazis and ascended to prominent, dangerous roles. After the war and through twists of circumstance, they became friends, and through their passionate determination and rare talent they emerged as leading voices of modern literature and biology, each receiving the Nobel Prize in their respective fields. <br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing upon a wealth of previously unpublished and unknown material gathered over several years of research, <i>Brave Genius</i> tells the story of how each man endured the most terrible episode of the twentieth century and then blossomed into extraordinarily creative and engaged individuals. It is a story of the transformation of ordinary lives into exceptional lives by extraordinary events--of courage in the face of overwhelming adversity, the flowering of creative genius, deep friendship, and of profound concern for and insight into the human condition.</p><p><b>Sean B.

IT IS NOT FOR US TO IMPOSE QUALIFICATIONS UPON THE DIVINE OR PRESUME TO GUESS ITS INTENTIONS. <br>(FORMER FIELD MASTER AVU MED &#x2018;TELCAM OF THE SANGHEILI&nbsp; <i>NERU PE&nbsp;</i>&#x2018; <i>ODOSIMA</i>&#x2014;SERVANTS OF THE ABIDING TRUTH&#x2014;ON REVELATIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE FORERUNNERS) <br>FORMER COLONY OF NEW LLANELLI, BRUNEL SYSTEM: JANUARY 2553. <br>It was an ugly bastard, and the temptation to kill it where it stood was almost more than Serin Osman could handle. <br>It was also pretty upset. Its arms flailed as if it was on some passionate Sangheili rant about politics or religion or whatever they played instead of football, its cloverleaf jaws snapping open and shut like a demented gin-trap. Osman watched from the shuttle cargo bay with her rifle resting on the control panel. Matters could get out of hand with a two-and-a-half-meter alien before you knew it. She was ready to drop the thing before it crushed Phillips. <br>He could actually speak their language, even if some of the sounds defied simple human jaws. She wondered what he sounded like to them. He was making mirroring gestures back at the Sangheili, and although she couldn&#x2019;t hear the conversation it seemed to be working. The alien did that odd trick with its split mandibles, pressing the two sides together to mimic a human jaw and trying to force out more articulate sounds. <br>So the hinge-head was mirroring too. It was a good sign.&nbsp; <i>A good sign in a bad deal.</i>&nbsp;No, not a bad deal: a dirty one. Osman stepped down from the bay, careful to keep her rifle close to her leg so she looked prepared but not threatening. Phillips glanced over his shoulder at her, seeming oblivious of the risk. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d never take my eyes off that thing. God, what do they teach these academics about personal safety?</i> <br>She leaned against the hatch frame and waited, glancing at her watch to check Sydney time. Around her, the ruins of New Llanelli felt like a rebuke. The dead tapped her on the shoulder, appalled:&nbsp; <i>And you&#x2019;re talking to these bastards now? On our graves?</i> <br>A shaft of sunlight struck through a break in the clouds and threw up a bright reflection from a lake in the distance.&nbsp; <i>No&nbsp;&#x2026; that&#x2019;s not a lake.</i>&nbsp;Her brain had joined up the dots and made the wrong assumption. She eased her datapad out of her jacket pocket one-handed and checked. There was no body of water for a hundred kilometers on the map in the CAA Factbook. The reflective surface was vitrified sandy soil, mirror-smooth, square hectares of it where there had once been rye and potatoes. <br>When the Covenant glassed a planet, they really did just that. <br>Phillips gestured to get her attention and distracted her from the uncomfortable thought that the planet was making a point to her. He walked over to the shuttle, looking pleased with himself. <br>&#x201c;The Bishop wants a word,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I told him you were the boss woman. His English is pretty good, so play it straight. And don&#x2019;t call him an Elite. Use the proper name. It matters to them.&#x201d; <br>Osman pushed herself away from the bulkhead with her hip. &#x201c;What, like&nbsp; <i>bishop</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ignore that.&#x201d; Phillips&#x2014;Professor Evan Phillips, another respectable academic who&#x2019;d been sucked down into ONI&#x2019;s drain&#x2014;put on his serious face again. &#x201c;They told me he was devout, but I didn&#x2019;t realize&nbsp; <i>how</i>&nbsp;devout.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is that going to be a problem?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Might be a bonus.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, they do tend to stick to a plan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant that he&#x2019;s a fundamentalist. The Abiding Truth. Very,&nbsp; <i>very</i>&nbsp;old tradition of faith.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Prompt me. I&#x2019;m not an anthropologist.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re said to have squirreled away original Forerunner relics from the time of their first contact. Their equivalent of saints&#x2019; fingers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It must be my birthday.&#x201d; Osman wasn&#x2019;t sure when that really was. Today seemed as good a day as any. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ve got some schematics in a dusty drawer or something.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, don&#x2019;t keep him waiting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How is he with women? I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen a female Sangheili. Do they keep them in purdah or something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that simple.&#x201d; Phillips beckoned to her to follow. &#x201c;The ladies wield a hell of a lot of political power in the bloodline stakes. When you&#x2019;ve got a few hours to kill, I&#x2019;ll explain it.&#x201d; <br>She didn&#x2019;t, and it could wait. She walked up to the Sangheili, steeling herself not to call him an Elite or a murdering hinge-head bastard. <br>Osman was taller than the average man, and at one-ninety she wasn&#x2019;t used to having to look up at anybody. But the Bishop towered half a meter above her like a monument in gold armor. For a moment she found herself looking into a disturbingly featureless face before she settled on the black eyes and small, flaring nostrils just below them. The Bishop was sniffing her scent. Unsettling didn&#x2019;t even begin to cover it. <br>&#x201c;Captain Osman,&#x201d; Phillips said cautiously, looking back and forth between her and the Sangheili. &#x201c;Let me introduce you to Avu Med &#x2018;Telcam, speaker for the Servants of Abiding Truth. He used to be a field master but he&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; renounced the ways of the infidels and cleansed his name, because they&#x2019;ve brought shame and misery on the Sangheili&nbsp;&#x2026; and they deserve to hang from spikes.&#x201d; He seemed to be quoting very carefully, glancing at the Sangheili as if for confirmation. He gave her a don&#x2019;t-say-anything-daft look. &#x201c;He means the Arbiter.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam sniffed again. Osman could smell him, too. It was a faintly leathery scent, like the seats of a new car. It wasn&#x2019;t unpleasant. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Captain Osman. I&#x2019;m a shipmaster.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam would get the point. &#x201c;So I keep my word. May we talk?&#x201d; She gave Phillips her get-lost look. This wasn&#x2019;t for his ears, and that was as much for his own good as Earth&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Can you give us ten minutes, Professor?&#x201d; <br>Phillips nodded and turned to walk away. This was why Osman didn&#x2019;t like using co-opted specialists. If he&#x2019;d known what she was about to do, he would probably have gone all ethical on her. <br> <i>I might be underestimating him, of course. But his job&#x2019;s done. It&#x2019;s not his problem now.</i> <br>&#x2018;Telcam tilted his head to one side. Osman had to strain to make out the words, but it was no harder than concentrating on a bad radio signal. The creature really could speak pretty good English. <br>&#x201c;Shipmaster, my people have been punished because they had no&nbsp; <i>faith,</i>&#x201d; he said. A fine mist of saliva cooled on her face every time he hit a sibilant or an&nbsp; <i>F</i>. It didn&#x2019;t look easy to articulate those four-way jaws. &#x201c;The traitor Thel &#x2018;Vadam and his ilk now say the gods are deceivers, and so they shall die. We have been in thrall to mongrel races long enough. We have let the false prophets of the San&#x2019;Shyuum corrupt our pure connection to the divine. Now we shall do our penance and bring the Sangheili back to the true path. So what can you possibly want with us? Do you want to agree to a truce?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How were you planning on killing &#x2018;Vadam and the other&nbsp;&#x2026; traitors?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We have few ships left now. Few weapons, too. But we have our devotion. We will find a way.&#x201d; <br>Osman noted the energy sword on his belt.&nbsp; <i>We&#x2019;ve got a right one here. A god-bothering, heavily armed maniac. Lovely. I can do business with that.</i>&nbsp;She tried to find genuine common ground in case he could smell fear or deceit on her. A small dash of truth in a soup of lies worked wonders. <br>&#x201c;What if&nbsp; <i>we</i>&nbsp;supplied you with some weapons?&#x201d; <br>He jerked his head back. &#x201c;And why would you do that? The traitor sides with humans against his own.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Humans gamble. I&#x2019;m betting that your side will win. Dead friends aren&#x2019;t much use.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam made a little sound like a horse puffing through its lips. A fine spray rained on her again and she tried not to recoil. She picked up a whiff of something far too much like dog food. &#x201c; <i>Kingmaker.</i>&nbsp;This is your policy. You help us take control so that you know your enemy and think you can then control&nbsp; <i>us.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;re never going to be friends, Field Master. But we can agree to stay out of one another&#x2019;s way and lead separate existences. Too many lives have been lost. It has to stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam leaned closer again as if he was doing a uniform inspection. &#x201c;You have colonies here. This is part of the war. This is the cause of our enmity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of our colonies don&#x2019;t like us very much either. Humans kill humans too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How tangled your lives are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My, you&nbsp; <i>do</i>&nbsp;speak good English.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was a translator once. I interpreted your communications for my old shipmaster. I speak several human languages.&#x201d; <br>Well, that explained a hell of a lot. Phillips obviously didn&#x2019;t know, or at least he hadn&#x2019;t said, but Osman decided to cut him some slack because he&#x2019;d only been tasked to do one thing: to get her an audience with dissident Sangheili who were likely to disrupt any peace deals. He was lucky to get that far without having his head ripped off. <br>&#x201c;Well, Field Master, I think we can help one another keep our troublesome factions in line.&#x201d; Osman turned slightly to keep Phillips in her peripheral vision, just in case he wandered back and heard too much. &#x201c;It might require some discretion, because we can&#x2019;t be seen to ally with you. But an unstable Sangheili empire doesn&#x2019;t help us, and an unstable human one is a threat to you. Yes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And some of my brethren might not understand my willingness to talk to infidels. So we do favors, you and I.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed. For the greater good.&#x201d; Osman paused a beat and made sure she didn&#x2019;t blink. Sangheili had a military sense of honor, and the truth she was about to drop into the deceit went some way toward satisfying her own. &#x201c;If I thought &#x2018;Vadam would survive as leader, I would be doing deals with him instead.&#x201d; <br>She wasn&#x2019;t sure if Sangheili ever smiled. If they did, she had no idea what it looked like, not with that four-way jaw. But &#x2018;Telcam&#x2019;s expression shifted a little. The muscles in his dog-reptile face relaxed for a moment. <br>&#x201c;I have a condition,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I thought you might.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You blaspheme about the gods. You spread vile lies about them. This must stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We just showed you what the Halo was.&#x201d;&nbsp; <i>Oh shit. Come on, think. There&#x2019;s a way through this.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t set out to insult your beliefs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So the Halos are machines of destruction. So you say the gods themselves were killed by them.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam leaned over her, almost nose to nose. He was so close that she couldn&#x2019;t focus on those doglike teeth. They were just cream blurs in a purplish haze of gum. &#x201c; <i>Your</i>&nbsp;god chose to die for you and that is precisely why you revere him, yes? And why you say he also&nbsp; <i>lives.</i>&nbsp;This so-called proof about the Halos means nothing. Not even to&nbsp; <i>you.</i>&#x201d; <br> <i>And he uses the plural. Halos.</i> <br>Osman suspected that he wanted her to agree with him, to reassure him that gods could be both dead and eternal at the same time like some divine Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat, to put some certainty back in his life. She knew that feeling. But the last thing she wanted was a theological argument with a heavily armed alien four or five times her weight. She bit back a comment that her name was Osman and that he was thinking of someone else&#x2019;s religion. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had scientists who claim they&#x2019;ve disproved the existence of God, and others who argue you can&#x2019;t prove anything,&#x201d; she said carefully. &#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t made any difference to any of our religions. Faith is quite separate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then you understand.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam drew back. &#x201c;If you arm us&nbsp;&#x2026; if you stay away from our worlds&nbsp;&#x2026; then when we take power and restore the rightful ways, we will leave you alone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; she said. She almost held out her hand to shake on the agreement but thought better of it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch very soon.&#x201d; <br>The Sangheili just turned and loped away to his ship without another word. It was too easy to look at them and see only an ungainly animal with strangely bovine legs, and not a superior force that had almost brought Earth to its knees. Phillips walked up to her but didn&#x2019;t ask what had happened. His expression said he was bursting to find out. <br>&#x201c;Are we done?&#x201d; <br>Osman nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one enemy we don&#x2019;t have to fight for a while.&#x201d; She gave him a thumbs-up. &#x201c;Well done. I never thought we&#x2019;d get one of them to talk to us, let alone reach an agreement. We owe you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I admit it&#x2019;s satisfying to be able to put the theory into practice. And wonderful to have unique access to Sangheili space with all expenses paid, of course. Good old ONI. My taxes, well spent.&#x201d; <br>Osman headed back to the shuttle, suddenly aware of small fragments of glass crunching under her boots.&nbsp; <i>Damn, that&#x2019;s not broken bottles. It&#x2019;s vitrification.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t feel your academic cred&#x2019;s been stained by mixing with us grubby little spooks, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God, no. I&#x2019;m not that naive. I know what you&#x2019;re up to. Just don&#x2019;t tell me, that&#x2019;s all. I have to be able to deny it with a straight face.&#x201d; <br>So he certainly wasn&#x2019;t stupid, and ONI wasn&#x2019;t doing anything that countless governments hadn&#x2019;t done over the centuries to look after their interests. She should have expected him to work it out. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re doing what, exactly?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, I thought I was helping you establish diplomatic channels with the hard-to-reach Sangheili demographic.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told me not to tell you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, so I did.&#x201d; He winked at her. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve slapped a saddle on that tiger. Now you better make damn sure you don&#x2019;t fall off.&#x201d; <br>They settled into their seats and she ran the preflight checks before handing over to the AI. Phillips was whistling tunelessly under his breath, as if he was glad to be leaving. Osman had expected him to be reluctant to go home but he obviously had what he wanted&#x2014;some dazzling scientific paper, some award-worthy research, maybe even a lucrative book&#x2014;that nobody else in his field had, and that seemed to be enough. <br>He wouldn&#x2019;t be coming back here. He probably realized that. ONI regarded him as a single-use sharp. <br>&#x201c;Just remember that my enemy&#x2019;s enemy isn&#x2019;t my friend, Professor,&#x201d; she said, opening a secure comms channel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my enemy who&#x2019;s just taking a sidebar.&#x201d; <br>Phillips burst out laughing. &#x201c;You sweet, innocent little flower. You&#x2019;ve never worked in academia, have you? Red in tooth and claw. Feuds, plots, vengeance. The works.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can imagine.&#x201d; The secure channel indicator flashed and Osman lowered her voice. &#x201c;Osman here, ma&#x2019;am. Professor Phillips and I are on our way back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you for letting me know, Captain.&#x201d; Admiral Margaret Parangosky, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence, never raised her voice and never needed to. &#x201c;I assume things went well.&#x201d; <br>Osman could translate Parangosky-isms easily enough.&nbsp; <i>Have you set up the Sangheili insurrection?</i>&nbsp;That was what she meant. Few outside the Navy and the senior ranks of government knew who Parangosky was, let alone knew to fear her. Osman suspected she was the only person in the Admiral&#x2019;s circle who would always be forgiven even if she failed. But she wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to test it. <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Thank Professor Phillips for me. Safe flight.&#x201d; <br>Osman signed off and the AI took over. The shuttle shuddered on its dampers as its engines reached peak power. In a few hours, they&#x2019;d rendezvous with&nbsp; <i>Battle of Minden</i>&nbsp;and head back to Earth, where the mission would be over for Phillips but only just beginning for her. <br> <i>So far, so good.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do I get a gold star?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;Maybe an extra cookie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the best Turkish restaur...</p><h2>Best-Ever Breads - Fleischmann&#39;s Yeast</h2><p>This is one of my most-used cookbooks. It got so worn out I had to order a new one. The range of recipes is amazing, from regular breads to cinnamon rolls to holiday breads to pizzas and calzones. The pictures are extremely helpful, the recipes are well-explained, and they give wonderful hints as to if the dough can be frozen, etc. I had never made bread before I got this book and now we are hooked on having fresh bread. I especially appreciate the breads that rise overnight in the fridge--I can come home from work and still have fresh bread for dinner. They are also much healthier than many breads because they are low fat and you can make rye, whole wheat, and even herb bread. My friends now request that I bring the dinner rolls to every gathering and potluck! And the pizza and cinnamon rolls are a big hit with kids.</p><p></p><h2>Disaster on Windy Hill (Adventures of the Northwoods, Book 10)</h2><p>Deciding to spend her Calumet reward money on two horses, Breeza, a gelding, and Windsong, a mare with a mysterious past, Kate is devastated when someone sets the Nordstrom barn on fire and Windsong mysteriously disappears.

Is there a serial killer loose in Guatemala City, or is the fate of the young women who've gone missing--including the daughter of the Canadian ambassador--connected to the murder of a human-rights investigator looking into the decades-old massacre? Brennan, the protagonist of Reichs's popular series, is literally hip-deep in intrigue, between the well in Chupan Ya where she unearths the bones of women and children slain in Guatemala's bloody civil war and the septic tank in the capital where the remains of one of the missing girls turn up. Tempe is a standout in crime fiction's crowded field of forensics experts--she's one of its more complex and interesting protagonists, dealing with intriguing cases that often cross national borders and a personal life that's rich in possibilities the author skillfully exploits.

These 25 patterns have appeared elsewhere, either in collections put out by Rowan Collections (some of which are now out of print) or produced as special issues of knitting magazines. Still, while dedicated knitters may have encountered these patterns before, they won't have admired them in such glorious surroundings. Fassett's books are as much for looking at as making things from, and, as usual, everything in this collection--from the design, to the numerous color photographs, to the size of the print--shows thought and care. Detailed instructions and graphs are given for each of Fassett's designs, which include jackets, sweaters, and vests for men, women, and children. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Needlecrafters are crazy about Fassett. Such previous works as Glorious Knits ( LJ 1/86) and Glorious Color (Potter, dist. by Crown, 1988) established him as the foremost designer of knitwear and embroidery. His popularity comes from an inspired use of color and pattern that becomes an integral part of the garment's design. Most of his patterns are for experienced knitters, but even novices will be interested and inspired by his designs. With the exception of the popular Big Diamond Jacket from his first book, the patterns collected here have never appeared before.

If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad! Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbe's natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin's sense of security. Calvin's the kid we all wish we'd been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy -- and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers "Candid Opinions" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents' authority. "What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?" he demands. <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: "Eww, mud," says Calvin.

In 1540, twelve-year-old Jahan arrives in Istanbul. As an animal tamer in the sultan&#x2019;s menagerie, he looks after the exceptionally smart elephant Chota and&nbsp;befriends (and falls for) the sultan&#x2019;s beautiful daughter, Princess Mihrimah. A palace education leads Jahan to Mimar Sinan, the empire&#x2019;s chief architect, who takes Jahan under his wing as they construct (with Chota&#x2019;s help) some of the most magnificent buildings in history. Yet even as they&nbsp;build Sinan&#x2019;s triumphant masterpieces&#x2014;the incredible Suleymaniye and Selimiye mosques&#x2014;dangerous undercurrents begin to emerge, with jealousy erupting among&nbsp;Sinan&#x2019;s four apprentices.<br><br>A memorable story of artistic freedom, creativity, and the clash between science and fundamentalism, Shafak&#x2019;s intricate novel brims with vibrant characters, intriguing adventure, and the lavish backdrop of the Ottoman court, where love and loyalty are no match for raw power.</p><p><b>ELIF SHAFAK</b> is the most widely read female writer in Turkey and an increasingly active political commentator and columnist. Her books have been translated into more than forty languages. She lives in London and Istanbul with her family.<p></p><p>Of all the people God created and Sheitan led astray, only a few have discovered the Centre of the Universe&nbsp;&#x2013; where there is no good and no evil, no past and no future, no &#x2018;I&#x2019; and no &#x2018;thou&#x2019;, no war and no reason for war, just an endless sea of calm. What they found there was so beautiful that they lost their ability to speak.</p><p>The angels, taking pity on them, offered two choices. If they wished to regain their voices, they would have to forget everything they had seen, albeit a feeling of absence would remain deep in their hearts. If they preferred to remember the beauty, however, their minds would become so befuddled that they would not be able to distinguish the truth from the mirage. So the handful who stumbled upon that secret location, unmarked on any map, returned either with a sense of longing for something, they knew not what, or with myriads of questions to ask. Those who yearned for completeness would be called &#x2018;the lovers&#x2019;, and those who aspired to knowledge &#x2018;the learners&#x2019;.</p><p>That is what Master Sinan used to tell the four of us, his apprentices. He would regard us closely, his head cocked to one side, as if trying to see through our souls. I knew I was being vain, and vanity was unfit for a simple boy such as I, but every time my master would relate this story I believed he intended his words for me rather than for the others. His stare would linger for a moment too long on my face, as if there were something he expected from me. I would avert my gaze, afraid of disappointing him, afraid of the thing I could not give him&nbsp;&#x2013; though what that was I never figured out. I wonder what he saw in my eyes. Had he predicted that I would be second to none with respect to learning, but that I, in my clumsiness, would fail miserably in love?</p><p>I wish I could look back and say that I have learned to love as much as I loved to learn. But if I lie, there could be a cauldron boiling for me in hell tomorrow, and who can assure me tomorrow is not already on my doorstep, now that I am as old as an oak tree, and still not consigned to the grave?</p><p>There were six of us: the master, the apprentices and the white elephant. We built everything together. Mosques, bridges, madrasas, caravanserais, alms houses, aqueducts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was so long ago that my mind softens even the sharpest features, melting memories into liquid pain. The shapes that float into my head whenever I hark back to those days could well have been drawn later on, to ease the guilt of having forgotten their faces. Yet I remember the promises we made, and then failed to keep, every single one of them. It&#x2019;s odd how faces, solid and visible as they are, evaporate, while words, made of breath, stay.</p><p>They have slipped away. One by one. Why it is that they perished and I survived to this feeble age only God and God alone knows. I think about Istanbul every day. People must be walking now across the courtyards of the mosques, not knowing, not seeing. They would rather assume that the buildings around them had been there since the time of Noah. They were not. We raised them: Muslims and Christians, craftsmen and galley slaves, humans and animals, day upon day. But Istanbul is a city of easy forgettings. Things are written in water over there, except the works of my master, which are written in stone.</p><p>Beneath one stone, I buried a secret. Much time has gone by, but it must still be there, waiting to be discovered. I wonder if anyone will ever find it. If they do, will they understand? This nobody knows, but at the bottom of one of the hundreds of buildings that my master built rests hidden the centre of the universe.</p><p>Agra, India, 1632</p><p></p><p></p><p>Istanbul, 22 December 1574</p><p>It was past midnight when he heard a fierce growl from the depths of the dark. He recognized it immediately: it came from the largest cat in the Sultan&#x2019;s palace, a Caspian tiger with amber eyes and golden fur. His heart missed a beat as he wondered what&nbsp;&#x2013; or who&nbsp;&#x2013; could have disturbed the beast. They should all be sound asleep at so late an hour&nbsp;&#x2013; the humans, the animals, the djinn. In the city of seven hills, other than the watchmen on the streets making their rounds, only two kinds of people would be awake now: those who were praying and those who were sinning.</p><p>Jahan, too, was up and about&nbsp;&#x2013; working.</p><p>&#x2018;Working is prayer for the likes of us,&#x2019; his master often said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the way we commune with God.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then how does He respond to us?&#x2019; Jahan had once asked, way back when he was younger.</p><p>&#x2018;By giving us more work, of course.&#x2019;</p><p>If that were to be believed, he must be forging a rather close relationship with the Almighty, Jahan had thought to himself, since he toiled twice as hard to ply two trades, instead of one. He was a mahout and a draughtsman. Dual crafts he pursued, yet he had a single teacher whom he respected, admired and secretly wished to surpass. His master was Sinan, the Chief Royal Architect.</p><p>Sinan had hundreds of students, thousands of labourers and many more adherents and acolytes. For all that, he had only four apprentices. Jahan was proud to be among them, proud but, inwardly, also confused. The master had chosen him&nbsp;&#x2013; a simple servant, a lowly elephant-tamer&nbsp;&#x2013; when he had plenty of gifted novices at the palace school. The knowledge of this, instead of swelling his self-esteem, filled him with apprehension. It preyed on his mind, almost despite himself, that he might disappoint the only person in life who believed in him.</p><p>His latest assignment was to design a hamam. The master&#x2019;s specifications were clear: a raised marble basin, which would be heated from below; ducts inside the walls to allow the smoke to exit; a dome resting on squinches; two doors opening on to two opposite streets so as to prevent men and women from seeing one another. On that ominous night, this was what Jahan was working on, seated at a rough-hewn table in his shed in the Sultan&#x2019;s menagerie.</p><p>Leaning back, frowning, he inspected his design. He found it coarse, devoid of grace and harmony. As usual, drawing the ground plan had been easier than drawing the dome. Though he was past forty&nbsp;&#x2013; the age when Mohammed had become Prophet&nbsp;&#x2013; and skilled in his craft, he still would rather dig foundations with his bare hands than have to deal with vaults and ceilings. He wished there could be a way to avoid them altogether&nbsp;&#x2013; if only humans could live exposed to the skies, open and unafraid, watching the stars and being watched by them, with nothing to hide.</p><p>Frustrated, he was about to start a new sketch&nbsp;&#x2013; having pilfered paper from the palace scribes&nbsp;&#x2013; when he again heard the tiger. His back stiffened, his chin rose as he stood transfixed, listening. It was a sound of warning, bold and bloodcurdling, to an enemy not to draw any closer.</p><p>Quietly, Jahan opened the door and stared into the surrounding gloom. Another snarl rose, not as loud as the first but just as menacing. All at once, the animals broke into a clamour: the parrot screeched in the dark; the rhinoceros bellowed; the bear grunted in angry response. Nearby the lion let out a roar, which was met with a hiss from the leopard. Somewhere in the background was the constant, frantic thumping that the rabbits made with their hind legs whenever they were terrified. Though only five in number, the monkeys raised the racket of a battalion&nbsp;&#x2013; screaming, bawling. The horses, too, began to whinny and shuffle about in their stables. Amid the frenzy Jahan recognized the elephant&#x2019;s rumble, brief and listless, reluctant to join the tumult. Something was frightening the creatures. Throwing a cloak on to his shoulders, Jahan grabbed the oil lamp and slipped into the courtyard.</p><p>The air was crisp, tinged with a heady perfume of winter flowers and wild herbs. No sooner had he taken a couple of steps than he noticed some of the tamers huddled together under a tree, whispering. When they saw him coming, they glanced up expectantly. But Jahan did not have information, only questions.</p><p>&#x2018;What is happening?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The beasts are nervous,&#x2019; said Dara the giraffe-tamer, sounding nervous himself.</p><p>&#x2018;It might be a wolf,&#x2019; Jahan suggested.</p><p>It had happened before. Two years ago. One bitter winter eve, wolves had descended on the city, prowling the neighbourhoods of Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. A few had crept in through the gates, God knew how, and attacked the Sultan&#x2019;s ducks, swans and peacocks, creating mayhem. For days on end they had had to clear bloody feathers from under the bushes and brambles. Yet now the city was neither covered in snow nor was it exceptionally cold. Whatever it was that was agitating the animals, it came from inside the palace.</p><p>&#x2018;Check every corner,&#x2019; said Olev the lion-tamer&nbsp;&#x2013; a hulk of a man with flaming hair and a curling moustache in the same shade. Not a single decision was taken around here without his knowledge. Mettlesome and muscular, he was held in high regard by all the servants. A mortal who could command a lion was someone even the Sultan could admire a little.</p><p>Scattering hither and thither, they inspected the barns, stables, pens, pounds, coops and cages to make sure no animal had escaped. Every resident of the royal menagerie seemed to be in its place. Lions, monkeys, hyenas, flat-horned stags, foxes, ermines, lynxes, wild goats, wildcats, gazelles, giant turtles, roe deer, ostriches, geese, porcupines, lizards, rabbits, snakes, crocodiles, civets, the leopard, the zebra, the giraffe, the tiger and the elephant.</p><p>When he went to see Chota&nbsp;&#x2013; a thirty-five-year-old, six cubits tall and unusually white Asian male elephant&nbsp;&#x2013; Jahan found him high-strung, unsettled, holding out his ears like sails to the wind. He smiled at the creature whose habits he knew so well.</p><p>&#x2018;What is it? You smell danger?&#x2019; Patting the elephant&#x2019;s side, Jahan offered him a handful of sweet almonds, which he always carried ready in his sash.</p><p>Never refusing a treat, Chota popped the nuts into his mouth with a swing of his trunk as he kept his gaze on the gate. Leaning forward, his massive weight on his front legs, his sensitive feet pasted to the ground, he froze, straining to catch a sound in the distance.</p><p>&#x2018;Calm down, it&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; intoned Jahan, though he did not believe in what he said and nor did the elephant.</p><p>On the way back, he saw that Olev was talking to the tamers, urging them to disperse. &#x2018;We searched everywhere! There&#x2019;s nothing!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But the beasts&nbsp;&#x2013;&#x2019; someone protested.</p><p>Olev interjected, pointing at Jahan. &#x2018;The Indian is right. Must have been a wolf. Or a jackal, I&#x2019;d say. Anyway, it&#x2019;s gone. Get back to sleep.&#x2019;</p><p>No one protested this time. Nodding, murmuring, they trudged to their pallets, which, though coarse and prickly and full of lice, were the one safe and warm place they knew. Only Jahan lingered behind.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re not coming, mahout?&#x2019; called Kato the crocodile-tamer.</p><p>&#x2018;In a moment,&#x2019; Jahan replied, glancing in the direction of the inner courtyard, where he had just heard a curious muffled sound.</p><p>Instead of turning left, towards his shed of lumber and stone, he turned right, towards the high walls separating the two yards. He walked warily, as if waiting for an excuse to change his mind and go back to his drawing. Upon reaching the lilac tree at the furthest end, he noticed a shadow. Dusky and unearthly, it so resembled an apparition that he would have dashed away had it not just then turned aside and showed its face&nbsp;&#x2013; Taras the Siberian. Surviving every disease and disaster, he had been here longer than anyone else. He had seen sultans come, sultans go. He had seen the mighty humbled and the heads that used to carry the loftiest turbans rolled in mud. Only two things are solid, the servants taunted: Taras the Siberian and the misery of love. Everything else perishes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x2018;Is that you, Indian?&#x2019; Taras asked. &#x2018;The animals woke you up, eh?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah,&#x2019; Jahan said. &#x2018;Did you just hear a noise?&#x2019;</p><p>The old man gave a grunt that could have been a yes or a no.</p><p>&#x2018;It came from over there,&#x2019; Jahan insisted, craning his neck. He stared at the wall stretching before him, a shapeless mass the colour of onyx, blending seamlessly into the dark. In that moment he had the impression that the midnight haze was full of spirits, moaning and mourning. The thought made him shudder.</p><p>A hollow crash reverberated across the yard, followed by a cascade of footsteps, as if a throng of people was scampering about. Deep from the bowels of the palace, a woman&#x2019;s scream rose, too wild to be human, and almost at once was stifled into a sob. From a different corner another scream ripped through the night. Perhaps it was a lost echo of the first one. Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell into stillness. On impulse, Jahan made a motion towards the wall in front of him.</p><p>&#x2018;Where are you going?&#x2019; whispered Taras, his eyes glittering with fright. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s forbidden.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I want to find out what&#x2019;s going on,&#x2019; said Jahan.</p><p>&#x2018;Keep away,&#x2019; said the old man.</p><p>Jahan hesitated&nbsp;&#x2013; albeit momentarily. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll take a look and come back right away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t do that, but you won&#x2019;t listen,&#x2019; said Taras with a sigh. &#x2018;Just make sure you don&#x2019;t go further. Stay in the garden, your back close to the wall. D&#x2019;you hear me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, I shall be quick&nbsp;&#x2013; and careful.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll wait for you. Won&#x2019;t sleep till you return.&#x2019;</p><p>Jahan gave an impish smile. &#x2018;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t do that, but you won&#x2019;t listen.&#x2019;</p><p>Recently Jahan had worked with his master in the repair of the royal kitchens. Together they had also expanded parts of the harem&nbsp;&#x2013; a necessity, since its population had grown considerably over the last years. So as not to have to use the main gate, the labourers had made a shortcut, carving out an opening in the walls. When a consignment of tiles had been delayed, they had sealed it with unbaked bricks and clay.</p><p>A lamp in one hand, a stick in the other, Jahan tapped on the walls as he ambled along. For a while he heard only the same dull thud, over and over again. Then an empty thump. He stopped. On his knees he pushed the bricks at the bottom with all his might. They resisted at first, but eventually gave way. Leaving his lamp behind, intending to pick it up on the way back, he crawled through the hole and into the next courtyard.</p><p>The moonlight cast an eerie glow over the rose garden, now a rose cemetery. The bushes, adorned with the brightest red and pink and yellow throughout spring, looked withered, burnished, spreading out like a sea of silver water. His heart was pounding so fast and so loud he was afraid someone might hear it. A shiver ran through him as he recalled stories of poisoned eunuchs, strangled concubines, beheaded viziers and sacks thrown into the waters of the Bosphorus, their contents still wriggling with life. In this city some graveyards were on the hills, others a hundred fathoms under the sea.</p><p>Ahead of him was an evergreen with hundreds of scarves, ribbons, pendants and laces dangling from its limbs&nbsp;&#x2013; the Wish Tree. Whenever a concubine or odalisque in the harem had a secret that she could share with no one but God, she would persuade a eunuch to come here with a trinket that belonged ...</p></p><h2>Faithful Over a Few Things</h2><p>This book is based on three assumptions: (1) the pastor is the chief catalyst in church growth; (2) there is but so much time in a day, therefore, what the pastor can do is limited; (3) if the church and her leadership do a few things well, God will grow His church.

The candidate has been receiving anonymous threats, and Kate, who went to college with two of the staffers, is to become her shadow, watching the crowds at rallies and fundraisers. But just as she's getting started the campaign is rocked by the murder of their staff researcher, who, Kate discovers, was in possession of some damning information about the pasts of both candidates. In order to track the killer, Kate will have to delve into the past, in particular the grisly murder of a "good-time girl" during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1915. Little can she guess the impact a ninety-year-old unsolved case could have on a modern-day psychotic killer.</p><p>Politics has a way of bringing out the worst in people. Anne Gordaoff is running for Alaska state senator, glad-handing everyone she sees (and who doesn't see her first); her campaign manager will stop at nothing to get her candidate elected; her randy husband is exploring alternative methods of interacting with the constituency; her campaign researcher is digging up dirt on Anne as well as on her opponent; and said opponent has planted a mole in her campaign. All in all, it's the sort of situation PI Kate Shugak would do anything to avoid. Kate is still recovering from a job gone horridly awry--"World War III, Denali-style"--that killed her lover, Jack Morgan, and left her with a brutal scar on her throat and a glacier-sized lump of bitter grief within it. Machiavellian maneuvering is not her style. But when Anne, a Native American, starts receiving anonymous threats, Kate allows herself to be talked into a temporary stint as Anne's bodyguard. <p> The first body to turn up, however, isn't Anne's but that of her fundraiser and future son-in-law. The police are tempted to chalk up the murder to an adulterous liaison interrupted by a jealous husband, but Kate's not convinced. And when the campaign is rocked again by the murder of Anne's campaign researcher Paula Pawlowski, Kate must dig through closets filled with skeletons and dirty laundry: Paula had been combining standard politicking with research into her burgeoning historical novel. Old sins have long shadows, but could Anne's campaign really be connected to the 85-year-old murder of a Klondike prostitute?</p><p> Kate may make you think of Kinsey Millhone, Sue Grafton's California PI. Neither woman suffers fools gladly, both are fiercely independent, and both are as adept as porcupines when it comes to keeping people (and their unwanted attention or embarrassing sympathy) at arm's length. Dana Stabenow, in turn, shares Grafton's gift for capturing a character or a scene with a few words and a touch of humor. Here's her take on the rigors of the campaign trail--"Kate slept in a lot of different beds, and some were comfortable and some were not. She ate a lot of her meals standing up or out of a bag. She became sick of the sight of the back of Anne Gordaoff's head."--and on Mutt, Kate's 140-pound, half-wolf companion--"Like Kate, Mutt didn't care for a lot of noise about her person."</p><p> If <i>The Singing of the Dead</i>, the 11th novel in the Kate Shugak series, is your first introduction to Kate and the vast, unforgiving corner of Alaska she calls home, it will most likely send you scrambling for installments one through 10. If you're already a confirmed Shugak fan, it will have you waiting impatiently for number 12. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>0 1-hour cassette</p><h2>Modern Classics Go Between (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>L.P. Hartley&#39;s moving exploration of a young boy&#39;s loss of innocence The Go-Between is edited with an introduction and notes by Douglas Brooks-Davies in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there&#39; When one long, hot summer, young Leo is staying with a school-friend at Brandham Hall, he begins to act as a messenger between Ted, the farmer, and Marian, the beautiful young woman up at the hall. He becomes drawn deeper and deeper into their dangerous game of deceit and desire, until his role brings him to a shocking and premature revelation. The haunting story of a young boy&#39;s awakening into the secrets of the adult world, The Go-Between is also an unforgettable evocation of the boundaries of Edwardian society. Leslie Poles Hartley (1895-1972) was born in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford. For more than thirty years from 1923 he was an indefatigable fiction reviewer for periodicals including the Spectator and Saturday Review. His first book, Night Fears (1924) was a collection of short stories; but it was not until the publication of Eustace and Hilda (1947), which won the James Tait Black prize, that Hartley gained widespread recognition as an author. His other novels include The Go-Between (1953), which was adapted into an internationally-successful film starring Julie Christie and Alan Bates, and The Hireling (1957), the film version of which won the Palme d&#39;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. If you enjoyed The Go-Between, you might like Barry Hines&#39;s A Kestrel for a Knave, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Magical and disturbing&#39; Independent &#39;On a first reading, it is a beautifully wrought description of a small boy&#39;s loss of innocence long ago. But, visited a second time, the knowledge of approaching, unavoidable tragedy makes it far more poignant and painful&#39; Express</p><p>"An intelligent, complex and beautifully felt evocation of nascent boyhood sexuality that is also a searching exploration of the nature of memory and myth" --Douglas Brooks-Davies<p> An invitation to a friend's house changes an adolescent boy's life. Discovering an old diary, Leo, now in his sixties, is drawn back to the hot summer of 1900 and his visit to Brandham Hall. The past comes to life as Leo recalls the events and devastating outcome that destroyed his beliefs and future hopes.</p><p> The first annotated edition of L.P. Hartley's great classic, the present text generally follows that of the first edition of 1953 and also includes a number of small but significant corrections based on the surviving holograph of <i>The Go-Between</i>.</p><p> Lord David Cecil described L.P. Hartley as "One of the most distinguished of modern novelists; and one of the most original. For the world of his creation is composed of such diverse elements. On the one hand he is a keen and accurate observer of the processes of human thought and feeling; he is also a sharp-eyed chronicler of the social scene.

A British sea captain named Frederick E. Forbes saved her life by talking King Gezo of Dahomey into giving the girl to Queen Victoria of England as a gift: "She would be a present from the King of the blacks to the Queen of the Whites." As impossible as this tale sounds, it is a true one. Award-winning author Walter Dean Myers--piecing together her story from letters he found in a rare book and ephemera shop in London--paints a hauntingly detached portrait of the small African princess whom the heroic captain named Sarah Forbes Bonetta. <p> We follow her charmed but unlucky life as the Queen's prot�g�e through a succession of British middle-class households, beginning with the Forbes home. Because of her celebrated association and frequent visits with the Queen, Sarah grows up in an unusual position of privilege, education, and celebrity. On the flip side, she is keenly aware that her decisions are not her own, and as a rescued orphan under the Queen's protection, her life's path is dictated by those acting in what they perceive to be her best interests. It is hard not to feel that it was cruel of her protectors to wrench her (more than once in her life) from the adopted family she adores, and eventually to encourage her to marry a West African businessman whom she clearly stated she could never love, and who would take her away from her adopted country. As the epilogue states, "She was both unfortunate in her losses, and fortunate that those losses were not greater.... She seemed to find a measure of comfort wherever she was, but was destined to be apart from the world in which she lived." This story, rich with historic prints, photographs, newspaper clippings, excerpts from Queen Victoria's diary, and Sarah's letters, is both fascinating and tragic. We have Myers to thank for rescuing this fine woman again--this time from the forgotten shelf of a London bookstore. (Ages 11 and older)</p>Working from a packet of letters found in a London bookshop, Myers reconstructs the life of one Sarah Forbes Bonetta, a child of royal African descent who was rescued by a British sea captain from a sacrificial rite in Dahomey, became a goddaughter of Queen Victoria, and grew up in a succession of upper middle-class households. A celebrity in her day, Sarah, or Sally, as she was also known, visited the Queen regularly, traveled repeatedly between England and Africa, grew up to marry a West African businessman, named her first born Victoria, and died of tuberculosis in 1880, aged about 37. Filling in gaps with well-chosen passages from newspapers, memoirs, and the Queen's diary, plus occasional speculations``Snow! What must she have thought of snow?''Myers (Angel to Angel, p. 498, etc.) creates a credible, perceptive picture of her probable experiences, adding for flavor detailed accounts of her wedding, a royal wedding she attended, and a general glimpse of London street life. He suggests that, although she may have felt caught between two worlds, and fully comfortable in neither, she had a lively intelligence and a gracious, forgiving nature. A generous selection of contemporary prints and photographs includes both British and African scenes, as well as portraits of Sarah and both Victorias. This solidly researched biography will enthrall readers, and ranks among Myers's best writing. (bibliography) (Biography. 11-13) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Most Legion forces on Azeroth have been slain or driven into hiding. Yet now a mysterious energy rift in the mountains of Kalimdor propels three heroes to the distant past: the dragon mage Krasus, the human wizard Rhonin, and the weathered orc veteran Broxigar. It is a time long before orcs, humans, or even high elves roamed the world. A time that marks the Legion&#39;s first invasion of Azeroth, brought about by Queen Azshara and other night elf nobles. A time when the Dragon Aspects are at the height of their power -- unaware that one of their own will soon turn on the world he was charged to protect.</p><p>Richard A.

When first the vast, walled edifice had been constructed, using magic that melded both stone and forest into a single, cohesive form, it had been a wonder to touch the heart of any who saw it. Its towers were trees strengthened by rock, with jutting spires and high, open windows. The walls were volcanic stone raised up, then bound tightly by draping vines and giant roots. The main palace at the center had originally been created by the mystical binding of more than a hundred giant, ancient trees. Bent in together, they had formed the skeleton of the rounded center, over which the stone and vines had been set. </p><p> A wonder to touch the hearts of all when first it had been built, now it touched the fears of some. An unsettling aura enshrouded it, one heightened this stormy night. The few who peered at the ancient edifice now quickly averted their gaze. </p><p> Those who looked instead to the waters below it found no peace, either. The ebony lake was now in violent, unnatural turmoil. Churning waves as high as the palace rose and fell in the distance, crashing with a roar. Lightning played over its vast body, lightning gold, crimson, or the green of decay. Thunder rumbled like a thousand dragons and those who lived around its shores huddled close, uncertain as to what sort of storm might be unleashed. </p><p> On the walls surrounding the palace, ominous guards in forest-green armor and wielding lances and swords glared warily about. They watched not only beyond the walls for foolish trespassers, but on occasion surreptitiously glanced within...particularly at the main tower, where they sensed unpredictable energies at play. </p><p> And in that high tower, in a stone chamber sealed from the sight of those outside, tall, narrow figures in iridescent robes of turquoise, embroidered with stylized, silver images of nature, bent over a six-sided pattern written into the floor. At the center of the pattern, symbols in a language archaic even to the wielders flared with lives of their own. </p><p> Glittering, silver eyes with no pupils stared out from under the hoods as the night elves muttered the spell. Their dark, violet skin grew covered in sweat as the magic within the pattern amplified. All but one looked weary, ready to succumb to exhaustion. That one, overseeing the casting, watched the process not with silver orbs like the rest, but rather false black ones with streaks of ruby running horizontal along the centers. But despite the false eyes, he noted every detail, every inflection by the others. His long, narrow face, narrow even for an elf, wore an expression of hunger and anticipation as he silently drove them on. </p><p> One other watched all of this, drinking in every word and gesture. Seated on a luxurious chair of ivory and leather, her rich, silver hair framing her perfect features and the silken gown -- as golden as her eyes -- doing the same for her exquisite form, she was every inch the vision of a queen. She leaned back against the chair, sipping wine from a golden goblet. Her jeweled bracelets tinkled as her hand moved and the ruby in the tiara she wore glistened in the light of the sorcerous energies the others had summoned. </p><p> Now and then her gaze shifted ever so slightly to study the dark-eyed figure, her full lips pursing in something approaching suspicion. Yet, when once he suddenly glanced her way, as if sensing her observation, all suspicion vanished, replaced by a languid smile. </p><p> The chanting continued. </p><p> The black lake churned madly. </p><p> There had been a war and it had ended. </p><p> So, Krasus knew, history would eventually record what had happened. Almost lost in that recording would be the countless personal lives destroyed, the lands ravaged, and the near-destruction of the entire mortal world. </p><p> <i>Even the memories of dragons are fleeting under such circumstances</i>, the pale, gray-robed figure conceded to himself. He understood that very well, for although to most eyes he resembled a lanky, almost elven figure with hawklike features, silvering hair, and three long scars traveling down his right cheek, he was much more than that. To most, he was known as a wizard, but to a select few he was called <i>Korialstrasz</i> -- a name only a dragon would wear. </p><p> Krasus had been born a dragon, a majestic red one, the youngest of the great Alexstrasza's consorts. She, the Aspect of Life, was his dearest companion...yet once again he dragged himself away from her to study the plights and futures of the short-lived races. </p><p> In the hidden, rock-hewn abode he had chosen for his new sanctum, Krasus looked over the world of Azeroth. The gleaming emerald crystal enabled him to see whatever land, whatever individual, he desired. </p><p> And everywhere that the dragon mage looked, he saw devastation. </p><p> It seemed as if it had only been a few years ago when the grotesque, green-skinned behemoths called orcs, who had invaded the world from beyond, were defeated. With their remaining numbers kept in encampments, Krasus had believed the world ready for peace. Yet, that peace had been short-lived. The Alliance -- the human-led coalition that had been the forefront of the resistance -- had immediately begun to crumble, its members vying for power over one another. Part of that had been the fault of dragons -- or the one dragon, Deathwing -- but much had simply been the greed and desire of humans, dwarves, and elves. </p><p> Yet, even that would have passed with little concern if not for the coming of the Burning Legion. </p><p> Today, Krasus surveyed distant Kalimdor, located on the far side of the sea. Even now, areas of it resembled a land after a terrible volcanic eruption. No life, no semblance of civilization, remained in those areas. It had not been any natural force, however, that had rent the land so. The Burning Legion had left nothing in its wake but death. </p><p> The fiery demons had come from a place beyond reality. Magic was what they sought, magic they devoured. Attacking in conjunction with their monstrous pawns, the Undead Scourge, they had thought to lay waste to the world. Yet, they had not counted on the most unlikely alliance of all... </p><p> The orcs, once also their puppets, had turned on them. They had joined the humans, elves, dwarves, and dragons to decimate the demonic warriors and ghoulish beasts and push the remnants back into the hellish beyond. Thousands had perished, but the alternative... </p><p> The dragon mage snorted. In truth, there had been no alternative. </p><p> Krasus waved long, tapering fingers over the orb, summoning a vision of the orcs. The view blurred momentarily, then revealed a mountainous, rocky area farther inland. A harsh land, but one still full of life and capable of supporting the new colonists. </p><p> Already, several stone structures had risen in the main settlement, where the Warchief and one of the heroes of the war, Thrall, ruled. The high, rounded edifice that served as his quarters was crude by the standards of any other race, but orcs had a propensity toward basics. Extravagance to an orc was having a permanent place to live at all. They had been nomads or prisoners for so long that the concept of "home" had been all but lost. </p><p> Several of the massive, greenish figures tilled a field. Watching the tusked, brutish-looking workers, Krasus marveled at the concept of orc farmers. Thrall, however, was a highly unusual orc and he had readily grasped the ideas that would return stability to his people. </p><p> Stability was something the entire world needed badly. With another wave of his hand, the dragon mage dismissed Kalimdor, summoning now a much closer location -- the once proud capital of his favored Dalaran. Ruled by the wizards of the Kirin Tor, the prime wielders of magic, it had been at the forefront of the Alliance's battle against the Burning Legion in Lordaeron and one of the first and most prized targets of the demons in turn. </p><p> Dalaran lay half in ruins. The once-proud spires had been all but shattered. The great libraries burned. Countless generations of knowledge had been lost...and with them countless lives. Even the council had suffered badly. Several of those Krasus had counted as friends or at least respected colleagues had been slain. The leadership was in disarray and he knew that he would have to step in to lend a hand. Dalaran needed to speak with one voice, if only to keep what remained of the splintered Alliance intact. </p><p> Yet, despite the turmoil and tribulations still ahead, the dragon did have hope. The problems of the world were surmountable ones. No more fear of orcs, no more fear of demons. Azeroth would struggle, but in the end, Krasus not only thought it would survive, he fully believed it would thrive. </p><p> He dismissed the emerald crystal and rose. The Dragon Queen, his beloved Alexstrasza, would be awaiting him. She suspected his desire to return to help the mortal world and, of all dragons, she most understood. He would transform to his true self, bid her farewell -- for a time -- and depart before regrets held him back. </p><p> His sanctum he had chosen not only for its seclusion, but also for its massiveness. Stepping from the smaller chamber, Krasus entered a toothy cavern whose heights readily matched the now lost towers of Dalaran. An army could have bivouacked in the cavern and not filled it. </p><p> Just the right size for a dragon. </p><p> Krasus stretched his arms...and as he did, his tapering fingers lengthened farther, becoming taloned. His back arched and from near the shoulders erupted twin growths that quickly transformed into fledgling wings. His long features stretched, turning reptilian. </p><p> Throughout all these lesser changes, Krasus's form expanded. He became four, five, even ten times the size of a man and continued to grow. Any semblance to a human or elf quickly faded. </p><p> From wizard, Krasus became Korialstrasz, dragon. </p><p> But -- in the very mid...</p></p><h2>A Question of Blood: An Inspector Rebus Novel</h2><p>While investigating the murders of two teenagers at a posh Edinburgh boarding school by a reclusive former soldier, killings that may be linked to a local group of Goth teens, Inspector Rebus is faced with possible suspension and painful injuries when the man stalking his partner, Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke, dies in a house fire that Rebus is suspected of setting. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Given his contempt for authority, his tendency to pursue investigative avenues of his own choosing, and his habitually ornery manner, it's a wonder that John Rebus hasn't been booted unceremoniously from his job as an Edinburgh cop. He certainly tempts that fate again in <i>A Question of Blood</i>, which finds him and his younger partner, Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke, trying to close the case of a withdrawn ex-soldier named Lee Herdman, who apparently shot three teenage boys at a Scottish private school, leaving two of them dead, before turning the pistol on himself.<p> "There&#x2019;s no mystery," Siobhan insists at the start of this 14th Rebus novel (following <i>Resurrection Men</i>). "Herdman lost his marbles, that&#x2019;s all." However, the hard-drinking, chain-smoking Rebus, who'd once sought entry into the same elite regiment in which Herdman served (but ultimately cracked under psychological interrogation), thinks there's more motive than mania behind this classroom slaughter. Perhaps something to do with the gunman's role in a 1995 mission to salvage a downed military helicopter, or with Teri Cotter, a 15-year-old "Goth" who broadcasts her bedroom life over the Internet, yet keeps private her relationship with the haunted Herdman. Rebus's doubts about the murder-suicide theory are deepened with the appearance of two tight-lipped army investigators, and by the peculiar behavior of James Bell, the boy who was only wounded during Herdman's firing spree and whose politician father hopes to use that tragedy as ammo in the campaign against widespread gun ownership. But the detective inspector's focus on this inquiry is susceptible to diversion, both by an internal police probe into his role in the burning death of a small-time crook who'd been stalking Siobhan, and by the fact that Rebus--who shies away from any family contacts--was related to one of Herdman&#x2019;s victims.</p><p> Now middle-aged and on the downward slope of his pugnacity (the high point may have come in 1997's <i>Black and Blue</i>), Rebus has become the engine of his own obsolescence. Overexposure to criminals has left him better at understanding them than his colleagues, and he only worsens his career standing by fighting other people's battles for them, especially Siobhan, who risks learning too many lessons from her mentor. To watch Rebus subvert police conventions and fend of personal demons (that latter struggle mirrored in <i>A Question of Blood</i> by Herdman's own) is worth the admission to this consistently ambitious series. <i>--J.

Only seven minutes away from anywhere in Boston you&#x2019;d want to go, it&#x2019;s a separate, self-contained world. It got a bad name during the Boston busing crisis of the 1970s, when the federal court forced students from two equally proud, isolated cultures (white Southie and black Roxbury) to switch schools. Images of screaming white parents mobbing school buses of black children, spitting at the intruders or throwing stones, ruled the TV news, matched by reports of stabbings and black kids dragging a white driver out of his car to beat him, crushing his skull. The mix created a classic case of &#x201c;contents under pressure,&#x201d; with predictable results&#x2014;Boom!<br> <br>Today, Southie&#x2019;s congresswoman is homegrown, but Irish-by-marriage and African American. So times have changed, but still, there are scars.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>The Southie of my childhood had been overwhelmingly working-class Irish American for generations. One of the oldest neighborhoods in America, it was settled by immigrants fleeing Ireland&#x2019;s potato famine in the 1800s. So it&#x2019;s not surprising that Southie is spiderwebbed with social connections. The first question anyone asks when you meet is, &#x201c;Are you related to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; I got to know Mary, one longtime friend, on the Southie Riviera&#x2014;Carson Beach&#x2014;when she hit me with, &#x201c;Hey, are you related to Kenny Lynch, my brother&#x2019;s friend?&#x201d; And the second question you always get is, &#x201c;Where do (or did) you live?&#x201d; The answer brands you because different stretches of our two-mile-long spit of land&#x2014;not to mention, nearby Dorchester&#x2014;were like different villages, each with its own character.<br> <br>The east or &#x201c;city&#x201d; side of Southie&#x2014;the section fronted by Boston Harbor that faces downtown, full of historic warehouses resettled by Fort Point artists (and now, techie startups)&#x2014;has gentrified beyond imagination. Even when I was a kid, though, being from City Point on the east side meant money. My home turf was the west side, called the Lower End. It&#x2019;s dominated by housing projects, Columbia Point (mostly black), D Street, and most important to me, Old Colony and Old Harbor (renamed for housing advocate Mary Ellen McCormack, mother of the speaker of the house in the 1960s). The last two each had twenty-two large three-story apartment buildings, and for big families, Old Harbor also offered about 150 two-story row houses.<br> <br>My family qualified for a row house at 51 Devine Way, near the rotary separating Old Harbor from Old Colony. I was the youngest of six children born to Barbara Kelleher and Philip &#x201c;Yapper&#x201d; Lynch. From what I hear, Yapper was a hard-working taxi driver. He&#x2019;d been class president at South Boston (Southie) High, which is where he met my mother. He loved to play baseball, and he loved to drink. Even on benders, though, he was charming, with the gift of blarney his nickname implied. He died at age thirty-four, shortly before I was born, so I never knew him. Still, whenever I said the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, &#x201c;Our Father, who art in Heaven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,&#x201d; I imagined that I was talking to him, as well as God, asking for his help and protection.<br> <br>As a child, I believed that my father had a heart attack. As an adult, I learned the truth: that at some point my mother had to throw him out, and he&#x2019;d spent a year in a halfway house, fighting to get sober. He&#x2019;d died of alcoholism, the Irish scourge.<br> <br>That left my mother with six kids to raise alone. Phyllis, the oldest, was born when my mother was just eighteen. Three boys followed&#x2014;Paul, who would co-own the Quiet Man; Gerry, nicknamed Jazz, who became a bookie then a cop; and Kenny, the cute one, who loved cars, especially BMWs, and is a truck driver. Then came Beth, my troubled sister, and, four years later, me. By the time I was old enough to know my siblings, Phyllis was nineteen and married, living in her own house in Braintree.<br> <br>With Phyllis gone, the burden of childcare must have been crushing for my mother. Since she refused to go on welfare, unlike many of our neighbors, she also had to support us. How the hell she managed, I can&#x2019;t even guess. For as long as I can remember, she worked two or three jobs: waitressing by day, collating from 7:00 p.m. to midnight for Winthrop Press, a company that made flash cards; and on the side selling Avon or Mary Kay cosmetics. She and her friends often met at our house, scheming ways to boost profits. They all aspired to Grand Achiever status at Mary Kay, hoping to score the top sales prize: a pink Cadillac.<br> <br>The pressure on my mother never let up, even after she got a new husband. Still young when she was widowed, she was a looker, with twinkly green eyes (and a green trench coat to match), high cheekbones, a perfect bouffant, and stylish cat&#x2019;s-eye glasses. Her boobs were huge from having so many kids. When she got off work and settled into her fabric recliner chair, after tuning in to her police scanner she&#x2019;d snap off her bra, which fascinated me. Once I tried it on and was shocked to find that each cup was about as wide as my whole body.<br> <br>When I was three or four, she met Steve, an ex-navy man who wasn&#x2019;t daunted by her houseful of children. When they married, my sister Phyllis begged, &#x201c;Ma, get the Pill or something. Six kids is enough.&#x201d; But for CIAs (Catholic Irish Americans), &#x201c;rhythm&#x201d; was the one form of birth control allowed. At Phyllis&#x2019;s wedding, my mother walked down the aisle pregnant, and she and my sister both had babies in 1971, just months apart.<br> <br>My baby brother, John, was cute and so chubby-cheeked that I&#x2019;d stuff his mouth with Oreos just to see how many would fit. He seemed to awaken some buried tenderness in my mother that the rest of us never got. Maybe John was more of a novelty, coming from a different father. I loved him, but I thought he was spoiled.<br> <br>If Steve had any fatherly instincts, I never saw them. He was a drinker but, unlike Yapper, had a mean streak. Mostly, we tried to avoid him. He worked as janitor at the John Boyle O&#x2019;Reilly School, contributing little family income. So money was a constant worry. Between her paying jobs, the housework, and keeping a half-assed eye on us kids, my mother always teetered on the edge of burnout.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>It strikes me now that I barely knew my mother, though I lived with her into adulthood. I stayed because I was broke, working to get a toehold in the world. My mother&#x2019;s dependency was the trade-off. Once, when I bullshitted my way into a chef&#x2019;s job on a cruise ship, she wrote me a seven-page letter&#x2014;basically a rant. How dare I just leave? Didn&#x2019;t I know how hard it was to have six kids and be abandoned by them all? Who would take her grocery shopping with her friends (meaning, who would drive them home after shopping, then stopping for a few martinis)? On and on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We didn&#x2019;t speak for months.<br> <br>By then, Steve was gone. When I was about thirteen, she threw him out, probably for lying around drunk half the time, cradling a huge bottle of port, with his Irish music playing, in his wife-beater, shorts, and sandals with white socks. So she relied on me for everything. I was always telling friends, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll catch up with you later. I have to run to the druggie&#x201d;&#x2014;the corner store, to buy her lottery tickets or one of her three daily papers: the Boston Herald, the Boston Globe, and the South Boston (Southie) Tribune; &#x201c;and then the deli,&#x201d; to get her favorite Land O&#x2019;Lakes cheese, sliced off the block on Number 4, just the right thickness. Or I was off to D&#x2019;Angelo&#x2019;s to pick up her favorite sub, Number 9&#x2014;steak and cheese with mushrooms.<br> <br>Christmas was a nightmare because I had to buy and wrap gifts for all my siblings, their spouses, and the grandkids, whose names and birthdays were recorded on a white card taped&#x2014;and retaped, in yellowing layers&#x2014;to the bottom of the wooden napkin holder on the kitchen table, her command post. Also on the table, which was draped with patterned vinyl to protect the fake wood, were stacks of the magazines she loved, like Good Housekeeping and Reader&#x2019;s Digest, interspersed with unopened bills; multiple half-used bottles of mauve-brown nail polish; and the syringes she used for her insulin, since she was diabetic.<br> <br>But when I was a child, she was a whirlwind, sassy and capable&#x2014;sewing, ironing the hand-me-downs we wore, sticking a bowl on our heads to cut our hair. Every couple months, she&#x2019;d subject Beth and me to Toni perms, rolling our hair up on dozens of tiny rods to give us masses of curls. To this day, I gag when remembering the chemical stench of a Toni perm.<br> <br>My mother was proud that instead of an apartment, we had a proper house, with a tiny fenced-in yard. Like all the row houses, it had a steel-topped sunken trash barrel out front that seemed to breed huge slugs, which freaked me out. To beautify the space, my mother planted roses and a lilac bush. If kids tried to pick the flowers, she&#x2019;d poke her head out the window and shout, &#x201c;You touch that and I&#x2019;ll boil you in oil!&#x201d;<br> <br>Other points of pride for her were the gleaming grandfather clock, which was the first thing you noticed coming into the house, and her hutch full of &#x201c;Hummels,&#x201d; little statuettes that people used to collect. Only I think most of hers were the giveaway kind&#x2014;like the little clay beer mug with a shamrock on it&#x2014;that you&#x2019;d get for spending a certain amount at Flanagan&#x2019;s Supermarket. Her favorites were elephants with the trunks pointing up, which she thought symbolized good luck. Every week Steve would dust her knickknacks&#x2014;a hangover from his navy training, I guess&#x2014;and shine the decorative white wrought-iron grating over our government-green front door as if it were made of brass.<br> <br>My mother could be funny. Once I opened the fridge to find my face smiling back at me. She&#x2019;d taped a picture to the rack to make me laugh. She could also be impatient and fierce. When I was in kindergarten, I was dawdling over breakfast one day and asked for a second bowl of cereal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you really hungry?&#x201d; she asked, suspicious. I said yes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you better be, because if you don&#x2019;t eat this, you&#x2019;re going to wear it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sure enough, I couldn&#x2019;t finish the second bowl, and she dumped what was left of it over my head. All day I was picking bits of Cheerios out of my hair. If this had happened later, I might have cut school, but kindergarten was the one grade I actually loved, before learning became a challenge for me. I still remember the day we put heavy cream in a mason jar and shook the hell out of it until it curdled. It turned into butter, which we ate on Saltines&#x2014;a miracle!<br> <br>Even that young, I had an interest in food, sparked by my mother&#x2019;s cooking. Though she made plain, down-to-earth meals, with heavy reliance on convenience products, she had particular tastes and added her own special creative touches. Like in her tuna-fish sandwich, which I loved, she&#x2019;d use only StarKist white albacore in water and Cains mayonnaise, never Hellman&#x2019;s, thinned with splashes of milk and a secret ingredient, Vlasic pickle juice. She&#x2019;d mash the mixture with two forks until it was creamy, spoon it onto Sunbeam, not Wonder Bread (which had too many holes), and top it with pickle slices. Before brown-bagging the sandwich, she&#x2019;d double-seal it in clear waxed paper topped with Saran Wrap.<br> <br>At school, I&#x2019;d stick the bag between the cast-iron tubes of the radiator, both to warm it up and so I could enjoy the tuna-fish-pickle smell until it was time for lunch.<br> <br>When I got home, I&#x2019;d often find her in the kitchen, smoking a Benson &amp; Hedges while reading the Herald or touching up her mauve-brown nails. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s for dinner?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit on a shingle,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna love it.&#x201d;<br> <br>And I would. It might be her fantastic flank steak, or spaghetti with her delicious meatballs made of ground beef, garlic powder, dried onion flakes, herbs, Parmesan cheese, and&#x2014;the magic touch&#x2014;Saltines soaked in milk. If someone in the family got lucky at keno, she&#x2019;d make a beef roast topped with sliced onions, seasoned simply with pepper and salt. My first hint of food attunement, as a child, was that I could tell just by the aroma when it was done.<br> <br>Her pork chops, though tasty, were always fried rock hard. She let them sit in the pan, half submerged in fat, until it was time to serve them with a scoop of Mott&#x2019;s applesauce. It must have been years before I ever had a pork chop that was easy to cut.<br> <br>On the side, she&#x2019;d serve canned peas, but only the Le Sueur petite ones, which were sweet and packed in watery syrup. Even their silver cans looked classy. (&#x201c;Can we have some of those &#x2018;leisure&#x2019; peas?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ask.) We&#x2019;d have baked potatoes slathered with Land O&#x2019;Lakes margarine, since no one ate butter back then, or instant mashed, out of a box, dressed up with saut�ed onions. I asked my mother once, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re taking the trouble to fry onions, why don&#x2019;t you fucking mash some real potatoes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Barbara, honest to God,&#x201d; she said, snorting at such pointless effort. &#x201c;Where do you come from?&#x201d;<br> <br>Today food is my language, the way I communicate with the world. So I wonder if, for her&#x2014;a woman with too many kids, too little money, a foul-tempered, hard-drinking husband, too much stress overall&#x2014;creative touches in the kitchen like pickle juice and saut�ed onions were a way of expressing love.<br> <br>Her recipes, her plants, her knickknacks, her scent (Emeraude cologne and powder, from a box with a fluffy puff), her sarcasm, her hard work&#x2014;to me, these were the factors that defined her. I had no clue as to her personal dreams, her view of our life, her aspirations for her kids, or importantly, her feelings about me. I couldn&#x2019;t even tell you her favorite color.<br> <br>Sometimes, in summer, I&#x2019;d get a flash of a cozier family life. When Steve was sober and in the mood, he&#x2019;d take my mother, John, and me on the ferry to Nantasket Beach in Hull. Paragon Park was there, with a giant Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, a water slide, the Kooky Kastle house of horrors, and other thrill rides. But what I loved best was the beach, cleaner and less crowded than our Southie Riviera, and the meal we&#x2019;d share: fried scallops and clams, plus onion rings and French fries, thinly sliced and perfectly crisp, served in red-and-white-checked cardboard boats with crunchy coleslaw and zingy tartar sauce. We&#x2019;d wash it down with tingly, real soda fountain Coca-Cola. As the sun began to set, we&#x2019;d make our way to the dock for the boat trip back to Boston, sunburned, full, and sleepy; feeling a warm glimmer of closeness, of belonging, that soon passed.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s a more typical memory: When I was around five, Sterling Square got a new playground, with cement turtles to climb on. But it didn&#x2019;t stay welcoming for long. Its benches were almost instantly tagged with graffiti. The sandbox was quickly polluted with sharp can tabs, bottle caps, and glints of broken glass. When it was sunny, all the steel equipment&#x2014;the slides, the monkey bars, and the chain swings with rubber seats&#x2014;got hot enough to sizzle your skin. The ground below them was peppered with cigarette butts, roaches burned to the nub, and here and there, crushed Miller High Life and Schlitz cans.<br> <br>Having been pushed out of the house with the usual &#x201c;Go play till the streetlights come on,&#x201d; I went to try out the grim new playground. Climbing on the jungle gym, I slipped and, whacking my windpipe on a bar, hurtled to the ground. For a while I lay on the littered cement, breathless, trying to swallow, petrified that I&#x2019;d broken something in my throat and was choking to death. When the other kids saw I was alive,...</p><h2>Je Suis Le Cahier: The Sketchbooks of Picasso</h2><p>The Sketchbooks of Picasso is the only collection available of the private sketchbooks of Pablo Picasso, which he began in Barcelona in 1894. For more than seventy years, as the young painter blossomed and matured into the greatest artist of the twentieth century, he kept a record of his ideas and thoughts, so that by 1964 there were 175 sketchbooks, a unique and startling picture of the mind of a genius at work. Accompanying the major sections are essays by six of the greatest American art historians: E.A. Carmean, Sam Hunter, Rosalind Krauss, Theodore Reff, Robert Rosenblum, and Gert Schiff. A foreword by Claude Picasso, the artist&#39;s son, and a reminiscence by Francoise Gilot, Claude&#39;s mother, provide a more personal understanding of the part the sketchbooks played in Picasso&#39;s life.</p><p>This is the catalog of an exhibition held at the Pace Gallery in New York, with essays by six art writers and Claude Picasso and Francoise Gilot. Picasso saved almost everythingselections from his notebooks scan over 60 years. He had a personal calligraphic shorthand and monumental fertility of ideas. Six complete sketchbooks and fragments of 36 others are included as "Saltimbanques" give way to "Demoiselles," "Sabines," etc. Commentary runs the gamut from scholarly to personal reminiscence. An expensive, quality production of interest to artists, art school libraries, modern art history collections.

The woman known as Mother Cutter, editor of Jaws, had died, aged sixty-four, of cancer and a memorial service was being held at the Alfred Hitchcock Theater at Universal Studios. I had known Verna socially and like many other young directors, I had benefitted from her counsel, support, and advice. She would take me to lunch and afterward treat me to an expensive cigar from the humidor of a nearby tobacconist. "Verna," I would protest, "how are you paying for this?" She'd grin merrily behind large glasses. "I'm wooing you, baby, I'm wooing you." She was a brilliant editor so of course after Jaws they'd made her an executive and stuck her behind a desk, which you might say was like promoting Captain James T. Kirk to Admiral. What a waste.</p> <p>Anyway, there we all were, crammed into the intimate Hitchcock Theater, listening to Ned Tanen, head of Universal and a devoted friend of Verna's, deliver the eulogy. Tanen, who had a mercurial temperament and was as prickly as the cacti that he loved to grow, opined that Verna Fields had been the only decent human being in this dirty, rotten stinking town&#x2014;or words to that effect. The thing about funerals, I find as a rule, is that you don't listen to such speeches critically. People say some outlandish or exaggerated things, carried along in the currents of emotion and the moment, so I don't suppose I blinked at Ned's impassioned words. I just sat there and felt sad thoughts.</p> <p>It was only later, standing alone outside the theater, surrounded by people chatting together in little knots while waiting to leave for cold cuts at Verna's house, that I became aware of someone else speaking. If this were a film and we were mixing this scene, the voice that impinged on my idling consciousness would be dialed up slowly and would go something like this: </p> <p>" ...;biggest crock of shit I ever heard in my life&#x2014;mind you: I take a backseat to no man where my affection for Verna Fields is concerned but I don't think I would have lasted thirty years in this business if I hadn't found it to be populated by some of the kindest, most loyal, generous, talented, and loving people I could ever hope to meet in this or any other lifetime."</p> <p>It was as if someone had thrown cold water on my face. The speaker, when I turned to look, was Walter Mirisch, a producer whose list of great movies is probably as long as George W. Bush's war crimes. </p> <p>Yes, I thought, decisively. This is true. I hadn't been in the business anything like thirty years&#x2014;it was more like ten&#x2014;but since my arrival in Los Angeles, a stranger in a very strange land, I had met with as much kindness, generosity, and support as I had found anywhere else. Maybe more. Me and Blanche DuBois. </p> <p>early days </p> <p>And in those ten years I had certainly needed (and continue to need) all the help I could get. One group I came to envy as I got to know them were children of those already in the business. Not that all of them were happy or even prospered, but like medieval stonemasons or shipwrights, they seemed to be part of a familial continuity that I didn't possess. There was Steven-Charles Jaffe, for instance, who with his father, Herb, produced the first film I wrote and directed,<i> Time After Time</i>. I envied father and son their professional bond. Herb told me, "I am a lucky man; I get to see my son every day." I had no such family anchor in Los Angeles. For years I was always conscious of being on my own in California, the boy who had run away to join the circus that was movies. Nobody from the world in which I grew up was in "show business." The children of my parents' friends followed their footsteps and became doctors or lawyers or went into "business" (whatever that was); I was the only one I knew who wanted to go to Hollywood and make movies. I must have set the fashion, for later everyone did. I don't think movies at that time were even regarded as a profession. The famous stars and directors hadn't studied to become filmmakers; they had sort of fallen into it. Second unit directors had begun as cowboys. Some were in fact Indians. </p> <p>In the years to come I would meet and become friends with many people in the business whose fathers or mothers had been in it before them. This conferred a kind of tradition on the whole enterprise, or at least to my way of thinking a legitimacy that I sorely lacked and missed. My own family never quite understood what it was that I was doing or attempting to do, even though it was tacitly acknowledged that I wasn't fit for much else. My father always was an astute and subtle critic of anything I wrote, a wonderful editor, but there his involvement ceased. In the years that followed, no matter how successful I became, or even how proud they were of my success, my parents never made it their business to master the nomenclature or glossary of terms that would have enabled them to better understand what I had to tell them about my life. </p> <p>"Mom, I'm in preproduction." </p> <p>"Uh huh. What's that?" </p> <p>And so on. </p> <p>I was born in Manhattan on Christmas Eve, just after the end of the war. My parents were a rather glamorous pair, a handsome psychoanalyst and his concert pianist wife, and postwar New York, if you were cut of such cloth, was definitely the place to be. I wasn't named Nicholas because of any religious association&#x2014;my parents were in fact third-generation nonpracticing Jews&#x2014;but rather in honor of my maternal grandfather, a Russian violinist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra. And when I say, "nonpracticing," I am understating. Neither my father nor I was bar mitzvahed. I never attended temple or religious school and never had the inclination. I was born without the religion gene. I was raised in an atmosphere of undoubted privilege and culture, fell in love with Mozart by age five, and thought Jews were people who read books with hard covers. My father was witty and also an excellent pianist. Once I heard him accompany Leontyne Price in the living room of our brownstone (shrewdly purchased east of yet-to-be gentrified "Thoid" Avenue, which then still had its elevated subway line); another time, in Princeton, after a filling Thanksgiving dinner, he did the same for Einstein, who soloed on a squeaky violin. (Sitting next to the great man at dinner, I complained I had a hair in my turkey. "Not so loud," he counseled me, "everyone else will want one.") Were we rich? I once asked my father. "We're comfortable," he explained, which was precise. Rockefellers we were not, but my father earned what he needed to live in what he might have characterized as a civilized fashion. My father, like his father, thought of himself as a liberal in the Jeffersonian tradition. He twice supported the candidacy of Adlai Stevenson. Years later, in my autobiographical novel, <i>Confessions of a Homing Pigeon,</i> I depicted my parents as circus acrobats, performing without a net, which is how they must have appeared to me. </p> <p>I happily absorbed everything that was thrown at me&#x2014;theater, music, books&#x2014;until it was time to go to school. It was there that my difficulties commenced. Today, I would've been diagnosed with some form of ADD, but at the time there seemed merely a mysterious disconnect between an evident intellectual capacity and an ability to translate it into any sort of academic prowess. I had difficulty focusing on anything in which I was not passionately interested. This certainly included math, where the numbers went all fuzzy and refused to stay steady in my head while I tried to add them, but also other issues and subjects that required concentration, organization, or the citing of specific examples to illustrate my point. I could read for hours and did&#x2014;but only the books that I wanted to read. I loved building model boats and could likewise spend hours at a time on them. Talk about concentration. I was crazy about plays, opera, ballet, art, dinosaurs, movies, and musicals&#x2014;all of which you could trip over in New York&#x2014;but my eyes would glaze over when the teachers started to talk. It's not that they were bad teachers, either; I went to a very sophisticated school. They were very good teachers; I was just a very bad pupil. I couldn't keep up. My mind wandered into narratives, some of my own invention, others culled from Jules Verne, Dumas, Arthur Conan Doyle, the Hardy Boys, the Lone Ranger, Rodgers and Hammerstein. I repeated fourth grade, which didn't do wonders for my self-esteem. </p> <p>Occasionally, I was taken to places or events where my parents thought a necktie was de rigueur. This article of apparel I loathed at first sight, and many red-faced struggles were involved in slamming me into it. I sometimes think I longed to make movies because I was sure you didn't need to wear a necktie. (In fact, old photos of many directors at work reveal them to be wearing neckties, so perhaps the dispensing of neckwear was more a generational transition&#x2014;my time had, simply, come.) </p> <p>When I was about ten, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, though this dreadful fact was kept from both of us by my father. She was told, instead, that she had a cyst removed. My father edited a volume of essays by doctors entitled, <i>Should the Patient Know the Truth? </i>He contributed an essay of his own to the collection, in which he asked, "What Patient, What Truth?", pointing out that how and what is communicated to the terminally ill patient may ease or increase his distress and ability to cope with his fate. He used the (unidentified) example of my mother,...</p></p><h2>Il Barone Rampante (Opere Di Italo Calvino)</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Beneath her palm the railing was smooth and cool and indifferent, a sharp contrast to her heated and agitated state. The fourth step creaked, but today the creak sounded less like the mere scurrying of a mouse than it did like the roar of a lion. Grace's legs trembled. She wanted to stop, to yell, "No, I won't do this," but after much discussion and argument, she had agreed that it must be done.At the top, in the dimly lit hallway leading to the bedrooms, Grace paused and looked back down the stairs into the foyer with its faded floral wallpaper, its standing coatrack, and its long, narrow, wall mirror over a walnut table that had seen better days and now played host to three straw baskets that served as receptacles for their mail, and past all this to the doorway of the kitchen. Two women stood in that doorway, one tall, her face determined, one short, twisting her hands. The tall woman nodded encouragingly and waved Grace on.Grace drew a deep breath, lifted her head, and started down the hallway feeling like a common thief as she slid the key into the door of Amelia's bedroom. Perspiration beaded her forehead, her upper lip. She tugged at the checkered bandanna tucked at her waist, wiped her face, and slipped one end back under her belt. The house, usually filled with kitchen clatter or chattering voices, was quiet now."How did I allow Hannah and Olive to badger me into sleuthing?" she muttered. Her mind raced. I'm about to commit a monstrousinvasion of Amelia Declose's privacy, opening her drawers, riffling through her closet, I, who detest prying, snooping, meddling in someone else's business. This overriding sense of guilt left her nearly breathless."Someone has to do it and you know her best," Hannah Parrish, her strong-willed fellow boarder had insisted.True, Grace was closer to Amelia than either Hannah or their meddlesome landlady, Olive Pruitt, but how close was that really? Anticipating entering Amelia's room, even under these circumstances, made Grace tremble.But if I don't do it, Grace reasoned silently, that pushy Olive will, and she'll shove and yank and dump things from drawers without any respect for Amelia. I'll handle Amelia's belongings with care. Resolutely, Grace squared her shoulders, took a deep breath, and turned the knob.Amelia's room was impeccable with white walls, white lace bedspread, lace-edged pillow shams, and no magazines strewn casually about as they were in Grace's room. Pink satin slippers were tucked neatly under the bed, and books were carefully stacked on the night table. Grace walked over and read the titles: Kahlil Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i>, a slim volume of Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets</i>, and a copy of <i>The Shell Seekers</i> by Rosamunde Pilcher. As she turned, the mirror over the bureau caught her eye. Why was it draped with a towel? Was it cracked or clouded? She peeked. The mirror was intact. Grace scrutinized the bureau, a model of fine handcrafting with its turned mahogany legs and trim. It bore the marks of time: a zigzag scratch on one side, a water stain on its surface, and behind the brass pulls were tiny nicks where fingernails had gouged the finish.It seemed least intrusive to begin with the closet. Amelia's dozen or so white dresses and several white pantsuits filled the small space. The floor was bare. The round flowered box that Grace removed from the shelf above the clothes rod revealed no letters, no diary, no address book, no photographs. Nestled inside the box, wrapped in sheaves of white tissue paper, lay a wide-brimmed, white straw hat with a cluster of cherries securely fastened on one side. Grace smiled. The jaunty hat reminded her of those worn by women strolling the Boardwalk in Atlantic City in old 1920s photographs.Standing on tiptoe, Grace shoved the hatbox back onto the shelf alongside several pairs of sturdy SAS shoes, a pair of New Balancewalking shoes with the heels worn down on the inside edges, and a slim pair of white Capezios.She could still hear Olive Pruitt's voice informing them about the new boarder just before Amelia arrived a few months ago. "I think Amelia Declose used to have money. She's been lots of places, like Europe. Fancy lady she is, you can tell to look at her. Prissy too, always wears white. Uses funny foreign words, too. I hope she don't put on airs." Olive had gibbered away in her usual magpie fashion as she dished up their dinner of corned beef and cabbage. "I run a simple clean establishment." She set a blue crockery platter on the table. "Nothing fancy, and I don't take kindly to snooty folk."Grace had tuned out her landlady's cigarette-strained voice, and when Amelia arrived, wearing a tailored white linen suit with a pale blue scarf tucked about her neck, Grace found her a pleasant, though rather reserved person, but not the least bit haughty, unless you counted--and Grace did not--the sprinkling of French expressions that slipped into her speech, especially when she was excited or pleased. Amelia's tentative smile, her soft voice, her unassuming ways, reminded Grace of friends back home in Dentry, Ohio, and Grace had gone out of her way to make Amelia feel welcome.The bureau drawer was open. Had she opened it? No. Yes. She must have. Silk scarves of varying shades of blue, neatly folded and stacked one atop the other, lay alongside lacy white handkerchiefs, lace collars, and a striped gray-and-white stocking case. The second drawer held white cotton underwear, silk vests, full slips, and long silk bloomers and under the vests a small, unlocked, sandalwood case containing several fine pieces of sterling silver jewelry.Increasingly uncomfortable, her hand shaking, Grace shut the drawer and took refuge in the upholstered rocking chair by the window. The rocking chair, the mahogany bureau, a Tiffany lamp, a battered steamer trunk, a watercolor of two girls sitting on a beach watching a sailboat race at sea, and two suitcases were all that Amelia Declose had brought.How much did she really know about Amelia? Amelia spoke longingly of the latest Broadway production in New York, enjoyed the music of Mozart and Vivaldi, and worried about cars driving above the speed limit on Sugar Maple Road. She volunteered little information about her past, and Grace had never asked. Yet it puzzled her that Amelia received no phone calls or visitors, and Grace nowrealized that there were no photographs in Amelia's room, not on her walls, not on her bedside table, not on her bureau. What quirk of fate had brought this lovely, well-traveled woman to Olive Pruitt's drab boarding house at Number 16 Sugar Maple Road in Branston, Pennsylvania?Grace raked her teeth across her lower lip. Her mind drummed a constant reprimand. This is wrong. This is dishonest. I'm betraying Amelia's trust. How will I ever face her? Outside the window she could see all the way down Sugar Maple Road. Straight as a ruler's edge, the solid, redbrick houses with their squat, second-story roofs, redbrick steps, and square, stubby front porches lined the street. A dark-haired boy rode by on a shiny blue bicycle tooting its horn."What's taking you so long? Did you find anything?" Olive's deep, raspy voice coming from the stairwell jarred Grace."Not yet. Be down soon."A moment of silence. Then the voice again, crackling with impatience. "Hurry up, it's almost lunchtime."Grace shivered. The idea of food sickened her. Her head ached."Almost finished." Grace roused herself and hastened back to the bureau where she had found the Capezio shoe box in the bottom drawer. She carried the box with her to the rocker, for it would be disrespectful to sit on Amelia's fine lace bedspread. Under a linen handkerchief and a tan leather-covered address book with blank pages were three letters with a North Carolina post office box return address. Grace wiped the perspiration from her upper lip. Her reading glasses hung about her neck on a grosgrain ribbon. Grace slipped them on and one by one, according to their dates, opened and read the letters.November 29, 1995&nbsp;<br>Dear Mrs. Declose,I hope this letter finds you well and that you will forgive my intrusion into your life. For the past year I have been researching my family's genealogy, searching not only for roots but for relatives. I myself am the last of my line, the Furrior line that is, an old man, bereft of children, who has outlived his family.I enclose a genealogical tree to illustrate the connection between us. You will see that we had a great-great-grandfather,William Austin Furrior, in common. Apparently our great-grandfathers went their separate ways and rarely communicated with one another after emigrating from France to America in the 1800s.I am taking the liberty of enclosing a snapshot of myself that was taken recently. I look forward to hearing from you, to sharing our family histories. It would be good to reconnect our two families through a friendship. I would appreciate having a photograph of you.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely, Arthur Austin FurriorThe distinguished white-bearded man in the photo reminded Grace of pictures she had seen of General Robert E. Lee, only this man sat, not tall and proud on a horse as the general was often depicted, but tall and somber in a wheelchair.The second letter was dated January 8, 1996.Dear Amelia,It is my hope that your holiday season was joyful and healthy. Receiving your letter blessed my Christmas and the New Year.Amelia is a lovely name. Thank you for writing and thank you for the picture. Your lovely smile reminds me of my dear wife, Eleanor, whom I lost eight years ago to cancer, a dreadful end for a kind and gentle lady. I sigh and agree with you that when we are young freedom is everything and time moves too slowly. Growing old is another matter; it is then that time dashes by and old friends and family matter most.I regret that my health makes it impossible for me to travel to see you and that you are unable to visit me in North Carolina. But it will be a pleasure to correspond with you, perhaps chat on the phone, and catch up on each other's lives.His letter went on for several pages and included a story of a big game hunting expedition to Africa in the 1940s on which he had accompanied his father. He wrote of their guide's vigor and enthusiasmand how the man, a retired veterinarian, had inspired and later encouraged him to become a veterinarian.Grace studied the photo of Arthur Furrior. Amelia, she knew, was sixty-seven. This man looked many years her senior. She picked up the third letter, dated February 2, 1996, five months ago, just after Amelia had come to live with them.Dear Amelia,It was a pleasure to receive your letter. Thank you for telling me about your life. I admire the good and important work you and your husband did with the Red Cross. You have seen more of the world than I have, and I've had a wanderlust all my life. Not only do we share a love of travel, but we share a love of music as well. I envy you hearing Maria Callas sing at La Scala Opera House in Milan. Music has been my solace in troubled times. Having been raised in Iowa, I have always longed to live near water, to go to sleep listening to the sound of the surf. How fortunate you were to be able to spend summers on the Rhode Island coast.My health is deteriorating rapidly and soon I may be confined to bed. Not a happy prospect. Like my father, I am a man who thrives out-of-doors, and in my chair I can at least sit under my oak trees and feed the squirrels and birds. But confined to my bed? I don't know, cousin. I don't know.But for this I am grateful, that my research led me to you, my own flesh and blood, my cousin. Your letters have brightened my life and made me happy. Thank you. You have given me, in my advanced years, a family. I remain faithfully,&nbsp;<br>ArthurGrace felt a tug at her heart. The handwriting had changed with each letter, becoming more shaky, reflecting Arthur Furrior's failing health. A small rectangle of paper folded and tucked into the envelope caught her eye--a cable dated June 19, 1996.WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU OF THE DEATH OF ARTHUR A. FURRIOR ON JUNE 16, 1996. J. B. PENNYSON, ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.Saddened, Grace folded the cable and tucked it back into the envelope."You dead up there? I'm coming up." Olive's voice unsettled Grace."Nothing here, be right down," she called, playing for time to calm herself.Grace slipped the letters and Arthur's picture into a deep pocket in her shirtwaist dress just as the doorknob turned."Nothing at all," Grace said, clutching the box. She willed her trembling hands to be still. The letters were so personal that she could not bear to think of Olive snickering over them. "Just more scarves. This is the last box. I've looked everywhere." Carrying the Capezio box to the bureau, Grace knelt and slipped it back into the bottom drawer. Then she pulled herself up, turned, and combed the room with her eyes, seeking telltale signs of her intrusion. Satisfied that there were none, she tucked her arm through Olive's, who guided her into the hallway and closed Amelia's bedroom door behind them.Hannah, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, raised her eyebrows as her eyes met Grace's."Absolutely nothing," Grace called down. "I'll be right down." Needing time alone now to compose herself, she headed for her own room.Grace's room was the largest of the three upstairs bedrooms, close to the bathroom she shared with Amelia. A bright room with a southern exposure, it had been painted a drab beige with faded, rust-colored curtains. Grace had transformed the room: painted the walls a pale shell-pink and placed a six-by-nine emerald-colored rug alongside her bed. Revitalizing an old chaise longue had been accomplished with a soft rose-and-white-striped cover, and she had hung new bright flowered chintz curtains. Olive had helped her shove the chaise longue to the low wide window that, like Amelia's window, overlooked Sugar Maple Road. And books, books everywhere, including treasured volumes that had nourished her imagination, her soul as a young woman: Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, an account of Schliemann's unearthing of ancient Troy, Lord Carnarvon's and Howard Carter'schronicle of their discovery and excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun.Bringing her hand to her chest, Grace moved it slowly around and around as one might rub a baby's tummy. Reaching the chaise, she eased herself down, pulled a small bottle of nitroglycerin pills from her pocket, and slipped two of the tiny tablets beneath her tongue.It was a relief when the pressure in her chest eased. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and reminded herself that Olive and Hannah were waiting downstairs. "Get up, go down," she muttered, then shook her head. Just another minute. A car horn sounded below, jolting her, and she stared about as if surprised to find herself in this room in this house. Below her window on Sugar Maple Road, two young women strolled by chatting, toting shopping bags. Across the street Mr. Spooner, a retired Barnum and Bailey clown, sat dejectedly on his front porch. Alongside him on another chair were bright red-and-blue hoops, a bulbous clown nose, and a ca...The three widowed 60-something women who lend "golden girl" power to Medlicott's episodic debut would be very much at home in Jan Karon's Mitford. Amelia, Hannah and Grace all live in a Pennsylvania boardinghouse, unhappily confronting the insults and injuries involved in aging. When Amelia inherits a deteriorating farmhouse in Covington, N.C., the three decide to move in together, gearing up to rehabilitate both the farmhouse and their lives. Although their alternately neglectful and overprotective grown children are disgruntled at their mothers' unconventional new lifestyle, the women find the time to become themselves, enjoying a combination of companionship and independence. Between gardening, cooking and exploring photography, the spunky trio jointly weather many trials and adventures including flood, fire, a claim on their property and romance. Medlicott's penchant for detailing local sights as minutely as a tourist map, coupled with the slow-lane pace, may be too warm and cozy for those accustomed to more action, and events that are surprising to the characters may be mundane to more sophisticated readers. But Medlicott's idea is a winner: women in their twilight years finding alternatives to large group homes or living alone. Solving an all-too-common housing dilemma, the three ladies inspire by forming a community in which they thrive and find new careers and loves, all with dignity and autonomy.

L. Mencken</i><br>&nbsp;<br>H. L. Mencken was wrong.<br><br>In this endlessly fascinating book, <i>New Yorker</i> columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea that has profound implications:&nbsp;large groups of people are <i>smarter</i> than an elite few, no matter how brilliant&#x2014;better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.<br><br>This seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate, how knowledge is advanced, how economies are (or should be) organized and how we live our daily lives.

Or they may have a faint memory of that short-lived moment when Regis Philbin became a fashion icon for his willingness to wear a dark blue tie with a dark blue shirt. What people probably won't remember is that every week <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i> pitted group intelligence against individual intelligence, and that every week, group intelligence won.<br><br><i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i> was a simple show in terms of structure: a contestant was asked multiple-choice questions, which got successively more difficult, and if she answered fifteen questions in a row correctly, she walked away with $1 million. The show's gimmick was that if a contestant got stumped by a question, she could pursue three avenues of assistance. First, she could have two of the four multiple-choice answers removed (so she'd have at least a fifty-fifty shot at the right response). Second, she could place a call to a friend or relative, a person whom, before the show, she had singled out as one of the smartest people she knew, and ask him or her for the answer. And third, she could poll the studio audience, which would immediately cast its votes by computer. Everything we think we know about intelligence suggests that the smart individual would offer the most help. And, in fact, the "experts" did okay, offering the right answer--under pressure--almost 65 percent of the time. But they paled in comparison to the audiences. Those random crowds of people with nothing better to do on a weekday afternoon than sit in a TV studio picked the right answer 91 percent of the time.<br><br>Now, the results of <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i> would never stand up to scientific scrutiny. We don't know how smart the experts were, so we don't know how impressive outperforming them was. And since the experts and the audiences didn't always answer the same questions, it's possible, though not likely, that the audiences were asked easier questions. Even so, it's hard to resist the thought that the success of the <i>Millionaire</i> audience was a modern example of the same phenomenon that Francis Galton caught a glimpse of a century ago.<br><br>As it happens, the possibilities of group intelligence, at least when it came to judging questions of fact, were demonstrated by a host of experiments conducted by American sociologists and psychologists between 1920 and the mid-1950s, the heyday of research into group dynamics. Although in general, as we'll see, the bigger the crowd the better, the groups in most of these early <br><br>experiments--which for some reason remained relatively unknown outside of academia--were relatively small. Yet they nonetheless performed very well. The Columbia sociologist Hazel Knight kicked things off with a series of studies in the early 1920s, the first of which had the virtue of simplicity. In that study Knight asked the students in her class to estimate the room's temperature, and then took a simple average of the estimates. The group guessed 72.4 degrees, while the actual temperature was 72 degrees. This was not, to be sure, the most auspicious beginning, since classroom temperatures are so stable that it's hard to imagine a class's estimate being too far off base. But in the years that followed, far more convincing evidence emerged, as students and soldiers across America were subjected to a barrage of puzzles, intelligence tests, and word games. The sociologist Kate H. Gordon asked two hundred students to rank items by weight, and found that the group's "estimate" was 94 percent accurate, which was better than all but five of the individual guesses. In another experiment students were asked to look at ten piles of buckshot--each a slightly different size than the rest--that had been glued to a piece of white cardboard, and rank them by size. This time, the group's guess was 94.5 percent accurate. A classic demonstration of group intelligence is the jelly-beans-in-the-jar experiment, in which invariably the group's estimate is superior to the vast majority of the individual guesses. When finance professor Jack Treynor ran the experiment in his class with a jar that held 850 beans, the group estimate was 871. Only one of the fifty-six people in the class made a better guess.<br><br>There are two lessons to draw from these experiments. First, in most of them the members of the group were not talking to each other or working on a problem together. They were making individual guesses, which were aggregated and then averaged. This is exactly what Galton did, and it is likely to produce excellent results. (In a later chapter, we'll see how having members interact changes things, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.) Second, the group's guess will not be better than that of every single person in the group each time. In many (perhaps most) cases, there will be a few people who do better than the group. This is, in some sense, a good thing, since especially in situations where there is an incentive for doing well (like, say, the stock market) it gives people reason to keep participating. But there is no evidence in these studies that certain people consistently outperform the group. In other words, if you run ten different jelly-bean-counting experiments, it's likely that each time one or two students will outperform the group. But they will not be the same students each time. Over the ten experiments, the group's performance will almost certainly be the best possible. The simplest way to get reliably good answers is just to ask the group each time.<br><br>A similarly blunt approach also seems to work when wrestling with other kinds of problems. The theoretical physicist Norman L. Johnson has demonstrated this using computer simulations of individual "agents" making their way through a maze. Johnson, who does his work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was interested in understanding how groups might be able to solve problems that individuals on their own found difficult. So he built a maze--one that could be navigated via many different paths, some shorter, and some longer--and sent a group of agents into the maze one by one. The first time through, they just wandered around, the way you would if you were looking for a particular cafe* in a city where you'd never been before. Whenever they came to a turning point--what Johnson called a "node"--they would randomly choose to go right or left. Therefore some people found their way, by chance, to the exit quickly, others more slowly. Then Johnson sent the agents back into the maze, but this time he allowed them to use the information they'd learned on their first trip, as if they'd dropped bread crumbs behind them the first time around. Johnson wanted to know how well his agents would use their new information. Predictably enough, they used it well, and were much smarter the second time through. The average agent took 34.3 steps to find the exit the first time, and just 12.8 steps to find it the second.<br><br>The key to the experiment, though, was this: Johnson took the results of all the trips through the maze and used them to calculate what he called the group's "collective solution." He figured out what a majority of the group did at each node of the maze, and then plotted a path through the maze based on the majority's decisions. (If more people turned left than right at a given node, that was the direction he assumed the group took. Tie votes were broken randomly.) The group's path was just nine steps long, which was not only shorter than the path of the average individual (12.8 steps), but as short as the path that even the smartest individual had been able to come up with. It was also as good an answer as you could find. There was no way to get through the maze in fewer than nine steps, so the group had discovered the optimal solution. The obvious question that follows, though, is: The judgment of crowds may be good in laboratory settings and classrooms, but what happens in the real world?<br>II<br>At 11:38 am on January 28, 1986, the space shuttle <i>Challenger</i> lifted off from its launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Seventy-four seconds later, it was ten miles high and rising. Then it blew up. The launch was televised, so news of the accident spread quickly. Eight minutes after the explosion, the first story hit the Dow Jones News Wire.<br><br>The stock market did not pause to mourn. Within minutes, investors started dumping the stocks of the four major contractors who had participated in the <i>Challenger</i> launch: Rockwell International, which built the shuttle and its main engines; Lockheed, which managed ground support; Martin Marietta, which manufactured the ship's external fuel tank; and Morton Thiokol, which built the solid-fuel booster rocket. Twenty-one minutes after the explosion, Lockheed's stock was down 5 percent, Martin Marietta's was down 3 percent, and Rockwell was down 6 percent.<br><br>Morton Thiokol's stock was hit hardest of all. As the finance professors Michael T. Maloney and J. Harold Mulherin report in their fascinating study of the market's reaction to the <i>Challenger</i> disaster, so many investors were trying to sell Thiokol stock and so few people were interested in buying it that a trading halt was called almost immediately. When the stock started trading again, almost an hour after the explosion, it was down 6 percent. By the end of the day, its decline had almost doubled, so that at market close, Thiokol's stock was down nearly 12 percent. By contrast, the stocks of the three other firms started to creep back up, and by the end of the day their value had fallen only around 3 percent.<br><br>What this means is that the stock market had, almost immediately, labeled Morton Thiokol as the company that was responsible for the <i>Challenger</i> disaster.

He worked for twelve years as an investigative reporter for the <i>Virginian-Pilot</i>, covering criminal justice and the state�&#x2019;s death row.*Starred Review* In the shared riddle of the "pure air" that allowed enclosed mice to live and covered candles to flame high, Jackson locates the thread linking the lives of a Frenchman who lost his life because of his ties to the ancien regime and that of an Englishman who lost his home because of his support for new ecclesiastical and political liberties. Ironically, the English champion of new theological and political ideas stubbornly clung to an outmoded science in trying to explain the substance he had isolated, while it was the French aristocrat who formulated the revolutionary new concepts that explained that strange substance. Jackson deftly recounts both the scientific triumphs and political tragedies that define the lives of Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier. Readers see--procedure by procedure--the experiments that turned a bit of mercuric oxide and one brilliant candle into a puzzling riddle for Priestley, and they witness the intellectual daring of Lavoisier in solving that riddle by repeating the British researcher's work with quantitative precision and a theoretically lucid new nomenclature. But readers also see the piquant personalities and turbulent social circumstances behind the science: a man so solicitous of his fellow creatures that he tries to revive suffocated mice is himself despoiled by mobs who regard him as a dangerous monster; a man who adheres to truth so assiduously that he measures it grain by painstaking grain falls victim to Jacobins who see in him a cheat and liar. A probing composite portrait of two martyrs for science. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reprint.</p><p>Gr. 3-6, younger for reading aloud. Beautifully designed and illustrated in a picture book format, this short anthology of poetry celebrates winter itself, not the holidays that fall within the season. The selection is eclectic, ranging from ancient Japanese verse through Shakespeare to Wallace Stevens, Richard Wright, Ogden Nash, and David Kherdian. While much of the poetry was not originally written for children and some of it is excerpted from longer works, the clarity of concrete images and the sounds of the words make the verse accessible to young people, particularly when it is read aloud. The background of each double-page spread is the same country road, fields, and farm seen in a variety of weathers and times of day and night. A white box is centered on each page, and within these boxes appear the poems and illustrations related to individual poems. Hyman's evocative line-and-watercolor artwork depicts the quiet beauty of winter landscapes and interior scenes as well as the child's experience of winter. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>This seasonal collection includes work by Rachel Field, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg and Emily Dickinson.

He concludes that Hitler was no worse than many of the others and that the Holocaust is publicized as "justification for Jews to have a Jewish state." He further claims that Roosevelt forced Japan into launching the attack on Pearl Harbor, explaining, "even a rabbit will fight if cornered," and suggests that Truman dropped the atomic bomb to intimidate the Soviet Union. He makes numerous other outrageous claims, which he supports with historical scholarship that is questionable at best, before concluding with analysis that the war against Hitler and the post-war U.S. policy of preventing another Hitler is the "root cause" of the September 11th attacks. Although he does present some useful information about the military and economic strengths of the Allied and Axis countries, this book is less an overview of World War II than a polemic about the evils of government action and the corruption of the Old World.<br><i>Mary Mueller, Rolla Junior High School, MO</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Emeril&#39;s New New Orleans Cooking</h2><p><p>Emeril Lagasse fuses the rich traditions of Creole cookery with the best of America's regional cuisines and adds a vibrant new palette of tastes, ingredients, and styles. The heavy sauces, the long-cooked roux, and the smothered foods that were the heart of old-style New Orleans cooking have been replaced by simple fresh ingredients and easy cooking techniques with a light touch. Emeril serves up a masterpiece in his first cookbook, <em>Emeril's</em> New <em>New Orleans Cooking.</em></p><p>Emeril offers not only hundred of easy-to-prepare recipes, but plenty of professional tips, shortcuts, and useful information about stocking your own New Orleans pantry and making your own seasonings.</p></p><p>New Orleans is all about food, and for centuries it has been dominated by two distinct styles, Cajun and Creole. For the uninitiated, Cajun food came out of the bayou and off the farms of southern Louisiana. Creole developed in the city with a healthy dose of European influence. �touf�es, crawfish bisque, gumbos, red beans and rice, shrimp r�moulade, bananas foster--the list is long, familiar, appetizing, and heavy.<p> According to Emeril Lagasse, this is the classic sauced, smothered, and rouxed Old New Orleans (ONO) cooking that made the city, and Emeril, famous. But even great chefs grow bored, and when Emeril opened up his own restaurant in the Big Easy he began to experiment with ONO cooking, infusing it with new cultural influences and fresh ingredients. The result, and apt title for his debut cookbook, is <i>Emeril's New New Orleans Cooking</i>. The food, as you might guess, is magnificent, and the cookbook is a masterpiece. Since Emeril is an immigrant to the Big Easy (from Fall River, Massachusetts), he doesn't fear messing with local tradition and overhauling the hallowed Oysters Rockefeller into Oysters in Pernod Cream with Fried Spinach. In fact, his genius lies in his willingness to experiment and a no-holds-barred approach to flavor combinations. Saut�ed Scallops with Saffron Corn Sauce or Stir-Fry of Sesame Ginger Crawfish over Fried Pasta are just a few of the examples. Along with more than 200 other recipes, it is easy to see why Emeril has become the chef of the '90s, and why New New Orleans Cooking is here to stay. <i>--Mark O. Howerton</i></p><p>Emeril Lagasse is a chef, restaurateur, and the author of eighteen bestselling cookbooks, including the recent <em>Emeril's Kicked-Up Sandwiches</em> and <em>Sizzling Skillets and Other One Pot Wonders</em>.

At first he panicked; his eyes snapped open as he imagined himself back in the Box--that horrible cube of cold metal that had delivered him to the Glade and the Maze. But there was a faint light, and lumps of dim shadow gradually emerged throughout the huge room. Bunk beds. Dressers. The soft breaths and gurgly snores of boys deep in slumber.<br><br>Relief filled him. He was safe now, rescued and delivered to this dormitory. No more worries. No more Grievers. No more death.<br><br><i>Tom?</i><br><br>A voice in his head. A girl's. Not audible, not visible. But he heard it all the same, though never could he have explained to anyone how it worked.<br><br>Exhaling a deep breath, he relaxed into his pillow, his razor-edged nerves settling down from that fleeting moment of terror. He spoke back, forming the words with his thoughts.<br><br><i>Teresa? What time is it?</i><br><br><i>No idea</i>, she replied. <i>But I can't sleep. I probably dozed for an hour or so. Maybe more. I was hoping you were awake to keep me company.<br></i><br>Thomas tried not to smile. Even though she wouldn't be able to see it, it would be embarrassing all the same. <i>Didn't give me much choice in the matter, did you? Kind of hard to sleep when someone's talking directly into your skull.<br></i><br><i>Waa, waa. Go back to bed, then.</i><br><br><i>No. I'm good.</i> He stared at the bottom of the bunk above him--featureless and darkly fuzzy in the shadow--where Minho was currently breathing like a guy with ungodly amounts of phlegm lodged in his throat. <i>What've you been thinking about?<br></i><br><i>What do you think?</i> Somehow she projected a jab of cynicism into the words. <i>I keep seeing Grievers. Their disgusting skin and blubber bodies, all those metal arms and spikes. It was way too close for comfort, Tom. How're we gonna get something like that out of our heads?<br></i><br>Thomas knew what he thought. Those images would never leave--the Gladers would be haunted by the horrible things that had happened in the Maze for the rest of their lives. He figured that most if not all of them would have major psychological problems. Maybe even go completely nutso.<br><br>And above it all, he had one image burned into his memories as strongly as a branded mark from a searing hot iron. His friend Chuck, stabbed in the chest, bleeding, dying as Thomas held him.<br><br>Thomas knew he would never forget that. But what he said to Teresa was: <i>It'll go away. Just takes a little time, that's all.<br><br>You're so full of it</i>, she said.<br><br><i>I know.</i> How ridiculous was it that he loved hearing her say something like that to him? That her sarcasm meant things were going to be okay? You're an idiot, he told himself, then hoped she didn't hear that thought.<br><br><i>I hate that they separated me from you guys,</i> she said.<br><br>Thomas understood why they had, though. She was the only girl and the rest of the Gladers were teenage boys--a bunch of shanks they didn't trust yet. <i>Guess they were protecting you.<br></i><br><i>Yeah. I guess.</i> Melancholy seeped into his brain with her words, stuck to them like syrup. <i>But it sucks being alone after everything we went through.<br></i><br><i>Where'd they take you, anyway?</i> She sounded so sad that he almost wanted to get up and look for her, but he knew better.<br><br><i>Just on the other side of that big common room where we ate last night. It's a small room with a few bunks. I'm pretty sure they locked the door when they left.</i><br><br><i>See, told ya they wanted to protect you.</i> Then he quickly added, <i>Not that you need protecting. I'd put my money on you against at least half these shanks.<br></i><br><i>Only half?<br><br>Okay, three-quarters. Including me.<br></i><br>A long stretch of silence followed, though somehow Thomas could still sense her presence. He felt her. It was almost like how, even though he couldn't see Minho, he knew his friend lay only a few feet above him. And it wasn't just the snoring. When someone is close by, you just know it.<br><br>Despite all the memories of the last few weeks, Thomas was surprisingly calm, and soon sleep overpowered him once more. Darkness settled on his world, but she was there, next to him in so many ways. Almost . . . touching.<br><br>He had no concept of time passing while in that state. Half asleep, half enjoying her presence and the thought that they'd been rescued from that horrible place. That they were safe, that he and Teresa could get to know each other all over again. That life could be good.<br><br>Blissful sleep. Hazy darkness. Warmth. A physical glow. Almost floating.<br><br>The world seemed to fade away. All became numb and sweet. And the darkness, somehow comforting. He slipped into a dream.<br>He's very young. Four, maybe? Five? Lying in a bed with blankets pulled to his chin.<br><br>A woman sits next to him, her hands folded in her lap. She has long brown hair, a face just beginning to show signs of age. Her eyes are sad. He knows this even though she's trying very hard to hide it with a smile.<br><br>He wants to say something, ask her a question. But he can't. He's not really here. Just witnessing it all from a place he doesn't quite understand. She begins to talk, a sound so simultaneously sweet and angry it disturbs him.<br><br>"I don't know why they chose you, but I do know this. You're special somehow. Never forget that. And never forget how much"--her voice cracks and tears run down her face--"never forget how much I love you."<br><br>The boy replies, but it's not really Thomas speaking. Even though it is him. None of it makes sense. "Are you gonna be crazy like all those people on TV, Mommy? Like . . . Daddy?"<br><br>The woman reaches out and runs her fingers through his hair. Woman? No, he can't call her that. This is his mother. His . . . mommy.<br><br>"Don't you worry about that, honey," she says. "You won't be here to see it."<br><br>Her smile has gone away.<br>Too fast the dream faded into blackness, leaving Thomas in a void with nothing but his thoughts. Had he seen another memory crawl up from the depths of his amnesia? Had he really seen his mom? There'd been something about his dad being crazy. The ache inside Thomas was deep and gnawing, and he tried to sink further into oblivion.<br><br>Later--how much later he had no idea--Teresa spoke to him again.<br><br><i>Tom, something's wrong.</i></p><h2>The Animal Family: A Newbery Honor Award Winner</h2><p><p>This is the story of how, one by one, a man found himself a family. Almost nowhere in fiction is there a stranger, dearer, or funnier family -- and the life that the members of <em>The Animal Family</em> live together, there in the wilderness beside the sea, is as extraordinary and as enchanting as the family itself.</p></p><p>"Once upon a time, long, long ago, where the forest runs down to the ocean, a hunter lived all alone in a house made of logs he had chopped for himself and shingles he had split for himself." These words ease the reader into the elegant, dreamlike world of Randall Jarrell's Newbery Honor book <i>The Animal Family</i>. One night, the lonely hunter hears the singing of a mermaid, and because "he himself was as patient as an animal," the mermaid learns to trust him, speaking to him in a voice like the water. In time they teach each other their languages, with many amusing exchanges occurring as the hunter tries to teach his new friend terrestrial words and concepts. The hunter explains, "The house is a big wooden thing ... that you stay inside at night or when it rains." "Why?" she asks. "To keep from getting wet." "To keep from getting <i>wet</i>?" the mermaid says despairingly. <p> The mermaid and the hunter become a family when the hunter takes a bear cub from its mother to live with them as a son. "The bear's table manners were bad. But so were the mermaid's--especially as she couldn't resist throwing the bear pieces of fish." Having a bear around seems perfectly normal, but not quite a complete family, so eventually the hunter captures a spotted baby lynx. When the lynx brings home not another dead partridge, but a little boy, the delicate, playful family dynamics change again. This book of low-key epiphanies is packed with delightful, illuminating, often unexpected comparisons of the ocean world and the land world most non-mermaids wouldn't have considered. Enhanced by a beautiful design and gorgeous illustrations by Maurice Sendak, this book is perfect for any reader--young or old--ready for a bit of gentle philosophy with a decided twinkle.

As shown in <i>Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World</i>, you had to have resolve as steely as anything produced on the factory floor. It's slightly ironic, then, to have these heroic, life-and-death tales of class warfare captured in the ephemeral medium of a comic book. Created as a collaboration between historians and graphic novelists, it is an engaging, informative, and sometimes uneven look at a time of violent social upheaval. The editors of this collection assume that their readers are at least somewhat familiar with the history of the Wobblies--this is not a children's primer. Many entries are similar, filled with pedantic text, but two in particular are superb, harnessing the potential power of the graphic novel form to great emotional effect. "Strike! (Lawrence 1912)," by Seth Tobocman, tells of ruling-class cruelty against striking workers with a ghostly grace born from its wood-cut graphical style. Nicole Schulman's "Mourn Not the Dead" strikes the right balance between storytelling and artistry, bringing the terrible reality of the Cook County Prison--where Wobblies died from mistreatment behind bars--to unforgettable reality. These entries alone fulfill the promise of a book that seeks to make the often overlooked history of the Wobblies relevant again. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i><b>Paul Buhle</b>,formerly a senior lecturer at Brown University, produces radical comics.

It was not a dignified execution. Reading the newspaper reports of that grisly - and botched - act of barbarism, more revenge than justice, and seeing the mobile-phone video images distributed immediately afterwards, I cannot have been the only one to feel that the language of daily journalism was inadequate to encompass such extravagant, larger-than-life events.</p><p>The cruel tyrant's army crumbles away. He himself escapes, disappears from sight for a time, but is eventually discovered, filthy and heavily bearded, cowering like an animal in a hole in the ground. He is taken captive, publicly humiliated, held in solitary confinement for a thousand days and put on trial before a tribunal whose verdict is a foregone conclusion. Hanging him, his exultant executioners almost tear off his head.</p><p>As in biblical times, God took to speaking to men again, instructing the makers of history. At a secret meeting between senior army officers in Kuwait during the run-up to the First Gulf War, Saddam had explained that he had invaded Kuwait on heaven's express instructions: 'May God be my witness, that it is the Lord who wanted what happened to happen. This decision we received almost ready-made from God...Our role in the decision was almost zero.'</p><p>In a BBC documentary, broadcast in October 2005, Nabil Sha'ath, Foreign Minister of the Palestinian authority recalled that 'President Bush said to all of us: "I'm driven with a mission from God. God would tell me, 'George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan.' And I did; and then God would tell me 'George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq...' And I did. And now, again, I feel God's words coming to me."'</p><p>It would have come as no real surprise had the conflict begun with a voice booming out from heaven, crying 'O President Saddam,' and continuing, as in the Book of Daniel, 4:31: 'to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field.' It takes the language of the Old Testament, the Book of Kings perhaps, to depict the details of Saddam Hussein's end in their full, almost mythic, dimensions. Thus:</p><p>It was the morning of the Sabbath, before the sun rose. And they brought him into the city, even unto the place of execution.</p><p>And they bound his hands and his feet as was the custom among them in the way of execution. And they reviled him saying, how are the mighty fallen, and may you be cursed by the Lord.</p><p>And they placed the rope about his neck and they reviled him again, praising the names and titles of his enemies, and saying, may God curse you, may you go down to hell.</p><p>And he replied, saying, Is this your manhood? This is a gallows of shame.</p><p>And again they spoke unto him, saying, prepare to meet God. And he prayed to God, saying, there is no God but the Lord.</p><p>And so they hanged him. And a great shout went up in the place of execution and in the streets and in the markets. It was the morning of the Sabbath, as the sun rose over the walls of Babylon.</p><p>Seeing George W. Bush's Iraq War through biblical eyes is not just a writer's conceit, the reaction of someone like me, introduced as a child to Middle-Eastern history by the Bible. Saddam too saw himself as a successor to the rulers of antiquity. He particularly modelled himself on Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BCE), conqueror and destroyer of Jerusalem and its temple, describing him, in a multiple anachronism, as 'an Arab from Iraq', who fought, like Saddam himself, against Persians and Jews. (Nebuchadnezzar was not an Arab but a Chaldean, there would be no Iraq for another two and a half millennia, and Judaism as we know it did not yet exist.) The emblem of the 1988 Babylon International Festival showed Saddam's profile superimposed on Nebuchadnezzar's; according to a New York Times journalist, the outline of his nose was lengthened to make him resemble the Mesopotamian king more closely. Saddam also honoured Hammurabi (c. 1795-1750 BCE), the ruler of the Old Babylonian Empire renowned for his eye-for-an-eye legal code, and named the most powerful strike-force in the Iraqi army the Hammurabi Republican Guard Armoured Division; another unit was the Nebuchadnezzar Infantry Division.</p><p>The Iraqi leader was, said the BBC's John Simpson, 'an inveterate builder of monuments to himself', undertaking great construction projects in conscious emulation of his illustrious predecessors. Giant images of the Iraqi leader showed him, like an ancient Sumerian monarch, carrying a building-worker's basket on his shoulder, although the ancients would have been pictured bearing the first load of clay for brickmaking, while Saddam was represented bearing a bowl of cement. He began a massive reconstruction of the site of ancient Babylon, although his rebuilding, said one architectural historian, was 'poor quality pastiche and frequently wrong in scale and detail...' Like the monarchs of antiquity, Saddam had the bricks inscribed with his name; thousands bore the rubric: 'The Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar was rebuilt in the era of the leader President Saddam Hussein'. Never one to display unnecessary good taste, he had the text written in modern Arabic rather than Babylonian cuneiform.</p><p>The political reasons for Saddam Hussein's concern to connect with the far distant, pre-Muslim, past of his country are plain. As in the case of the Shah of next-door Iran, who in 1971 famously declared his kinship with Cyrus the Great, founder of the first, Achaemenid, Persian Empire, any pitch for leadership of the Middle East demands that the pretender first neutralize the claims of holy Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, the cities of the Prophet, to be the sole ultimate source of Islamic legitimacy.</p><p>There is much irony in the fact that Anglo-American Middle East policy, from Operation Ajax, the deposing of democratically elected, socialist, secularist Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran in 1953, to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the overthrow of secular nationalist dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, has served in fact, if not intention, to ensure the continuing hold of Islam over nearly all the countries of the region. Thus inevitably boosting the claim of Salafi Islam, which looks to the immediate successors of the Prophet for its political models, to provide the only authentic principles on which to build a legitimate political system.</p><p>Perhaps Saddam - whatever else he might have been, he was neither stupid nor unperceptive - also recognized another, even greater, truth of Middle-Eastern power-politics. Our way of life and understanding of the world may have changed utterly since ancient times, but we flatter ourselves unduly if we think that our behaviour is in any way different, or that human nature has altered much over the millennia.</p><p>History tells us that the region the Greeks called Mesopotamia, because it lay 'between the rivers' Tigris and Euphrates, was fought over by Romans and Parthians, by Byzantines and Sassanians, by Muslims and Magians, until rank outsiders, Mongols and Turks, conquerors from distant Central Asia and beyond, created a desert and called it peace. Nobody with even a passing acquaintance with the history of the land could have been surprised at its reversion to confusion after the heavy Ottoman yoke was lifted from Iraq's neck in the 1920s, or the collapse into chaos after the deposition of the modern Ba'ath tyranny that held together the three former Ottoman provinces, mutually antagonistic and seemingly united only by the League of Nations to allow the great powers to extract oil.</p><p>But the attempts to grab control over the fertile Mesopotamian plain go back much further even than Roman times. Twice as far, in fact. And while the ancient powers who vied for sovereignty have long since crumbled to dust, their clashes still ring faintly in the air.</p><p>The bustling, thriving town now called Shush in south-west Iran, where the foothills of the Zagros Mountains run down on to the Mesopotamian Plain, is no more than 55 kilometres from the Iraqi border, another 70 from the Tigris. The streets are strung out either side of a slackly flowing branch of the Karkheh River, the air tinged grey-blue by the exhausts of the poorly maintained cars, which fight for space with crowds of pedestrians, bicycles, and men pushing heavily laden carts. Shush, ancient Susa, is the setting for the biblical Books of Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel: 'I was in Shushan the palace,' states the account of his visions in Daniel 8:2, '...and I saw in the vision that I was by the river Ulai.' Stand today on the main street that runs parallel to the river and you cannot escape reminders of the place's great antiquity.</p><p>In front of you, between the road and the river-bank stands the reputedly ancient tomb of Daniel himself - nothing Hebraic about it, but an unremarkably Islamic building topped out with an unusual spiral cone rendered in white plaster. (Daniel's story was supposed to take place some time in the sixth century BCE, and this sepulchre dates from 1871.) The shrine is greatly honoured by local Shi'a Muslims; visitors enter the building in a steady stream, to fall on their knees, recite prayers and kiss the elaborate gilded metal grille that protects the sarcophagus.</p><p>Across the street rises the gigantic mound that is the site of the ancient city, bearing at its top the fragmented stone remains of the Persian Achaemenid kings' winter capital. Walk around the ruins and you crunch over fragments of brick and pottery that may be as much as 5,000 years old, for Susa is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements anywhere in the world, probably founded not much later than 5000 BCE. From the middle of the second millennium BCE it was the capital of a state called Elam, master of this part of Iran long before the advent of the Persians, and founded by a people who may just possibly, from the linguistic evidence, have been related to the speakers...</p></p><h2>The Book of Ti&#39;Ana (Myst, Book 2)</h2><p>Ti&#39;ana, known among humans as Anna, is the first woman from the outside worldto enter the domain of D&#39;ni.

In the decade that followed, the movement accelerated producing tens of thousands of new churches and hundreds of thousands of new baptized believers. By the end of the decade, this movement of God had seen 1.7 million baptisms and 150,000 new church starts.<br> Ying Kai and his wife Grace, Chinese&#x2013;American Southern Baptist missionaries, developed the outreach and church planting program that they called Training for Trainers or T4T as a means of addressing the overwhelming challenge of an unreached people group numbering tens of millions of lost souls. Rather than simply doing evangelism, or discipleship, or church planting, the Kais felt led of God to train multiplying generations of national partners who in turn would train generations of the same. <br> In T4T: A Discipleship Re&#x2013;Revolution fellow&#x2013;Baptist missionary and author Steve Smith captures the story, principles, and spirit of Ying Kai's T4T. In this engaging 350&#x2013;page book, Smith describes how God is at work in the fastest growing church&#x2013;planting movement in the world today, and how its principles can be applied in your own ministry. T4T has already proven itself by adapting well to many other ministries, infusing them with reproducibility that enhances rather than competes with their own distinctive kingdom contribution.<br> Built on New Testament kingdom principles, T4T integrates evangelism, discipleship, church planting, and leadership development in a seamless process that has proven effective in multiplying new communities of faith. Though T4T was born in Asia, it is now bearing fruit in the U.S., as practitioners in Texas, Indiana, North Carolina and other states report multiplying generations of new believers, disciples and church starts.

Senior law enforcement officials are quick to blame a serial killer, yet their efforts to apprehend this criminal are peculiarly ineffective.<br>Meanwhile, in the county's small town of Surrender, Trajan Jones, a psychological profiler (and the world's leading expert on the life and work of one Dr. Laszlo Kreizler), and Michael Li, a trace evidence expert, once famed advisors to the New York City Police Department, teach online courses in profiling and forensic science from Jones's family farm. Alone and armed mainly with their wits, protected only by farmhands and Jones' unusual "pet," the outcast pair are secretly called in to consult on the case.<br>Jones and Li immediately discern that the various victims were all "throwaway children," a new state classification given to young people who are neither orphans, runaways nor homeless, but victims of a terrible phenomenon sweeping America's poor: abandoned by their families, the throwaways are left to fend for themselves. One of these throwaways, Lucas Kurtz, along with his blind older sister, cross paths with Jones and Li, offering information that could blow the case wide open.<br>Racing against the case's mounting stakes, Jones and Li find that they are battling not only to unravel the mystery of how the throwaways died, but also to defend themselves and the Kurtz siblings from the threats of shadowy but powerful agents who want to stop them from uncovering the truth. It is a truth that, Jones believes, leads away from their world and back to the increasingly wealthy city where both he and his long-dead intellectual guide, Dr Kreizler, did their greatest work. But will they be able to trace the case to New York before they fall victim to the murderous forces that stalk them?<br>Moving at the same rapid pace as his earlier books, yet with the same depth of historical and scientific research, Carr creates another rollercoaster ride of ideas and emotions.

He offers a new psychology that, if practiced, could reverse our widespread inability to get along with one another, an inability that is the source of almost all unhappiness.<p>Take an honest look at your life, and you will see no evidence that your children will have happier marriages; that you and they will get along better; or that they will do better in school or at work than you, your parents or your grandparents. Dr. Glasser claims that, lacking good relationships, more and more people choose mental illness, psychosomatic disease, drug abuse, senseless violence and sex without any thought of love.</p><p>For progress in human relationships, he explains that we must give up the punishing, relationship-destroying external control psychology that is by far the dominant one in the world. For example, if you are in an unhappy relationship right now, your unhappiness is caused by one or both of you using external control psychology on the other.</p><p>But he goes further. If, for example, you are depressed, your misery is always related to a current unsatisfying relationship. Contrary to what you may believe, your troubles are always now, never in the past. No one can change what happened yesterday.</p><p>In one of this century's most significant books on psychology, Dr. Glasser offers choice theory, a non-controlling psychology that gives us the freedom to sustain the relationships that lead to healthy, productive lives. Through clear, vivid language and numerous examples, he makes this vital new psychology come alive. Learning it could change your life.</p></p><p>Southern California psychiatrist William Glasser, the author of <i>Reality Therapy</i>, believes that almost all human misery is caused by people trying to control others. In fact, he says, the only behavior we can control is our own; by the same token, no one can make us do anything we don't want to. It's only when we give up spending our energy trying to force others to conform to our ideas or to keep them from doing the same to us that we are able to live the way we want to. Glasser makes this somewhat difficult material easier to understand with examples and case studies from his own practice. For instance, he tells a man whose wife has left him that his only choices are to change what he wants her to do or to change the way he is dealing with her. While doing these things will not necessarily bring his wife back, Glasser says, it will certainly make him feel better. "When we actually begin to realize that we can control only our own behavior, we immediately start to redefine our personal freedom and find, in many instances, that we have much more freedom than we realize," Glasser writes.In &#34;Choice Theory,&#34; Dr. William Glasser offers readers a new and far more effective way to get along with the people in our lives. He explains convincingly that, barring severe poverty or untreatable illness, unsatisfying or disconnecting relationships are the source of almost all crime, addiction, and mental illness, as well as marital, family, and school failure. For progress in human relationships, he explains that we must give up the punishing, relationship-destroying external control psychology that is by far the dominant one in the world. in one of this century&#39;s most significant books on psychology, Dr. Glasser offers us choice theory, a noncontrolling psychology that gives us freedom to sustain the relationships that lead to healthy, productive lives.</p><h2>No One Left To Lie To: The Values of the Worst Family</h2><p>&#x2018;Clintonism&#x2019; is not an idea, or a program; still less is it a principle. It represents what might be termed-were it not for its murk-the distilled essence of consensus politics. Unremarkable in its constituent elements, which are a mixture of opportunist statecraft, crony capitalism, &#x2018;divide and rule&#x2019; identity politics, and populist manipulation, Clintonism has nonetheless raised these ordinary practices to the level of theory. It has succeeded, argues the author, because of a stealthy appeal to the waning and insecure forces of an American liberalism gone bad. Christopher Hitchens followed Governor Clinton through New Hampshire in 1992, and has remained an assiduous student of his methods ever since.<br><br>In <i>No One Left to Lie To</i>, he profiles the rise and decline of some prominent Clintonoids, from George Stephanopoulos to the First Lady. He scrutinizes the debased new language in which the discourse of Clintonism has been couched, and proposes that, if successful, the Clinton machine will become the model of pseudo-democracy for the coming century.</p><p>The most vocal critics of Bill Clinton's presidency tend to be conservatives--think, for example, of William J. Bennett's <i>The Death of Outrage</i>--but there are those on the Left who are fed up with Clinton as well. Among them is journalist Christopher Hitchens (most prominently associated with <i>The Nation</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>), who has produced a slim but vehement volume outlining how "Clinton's private vileness meshes exactly with his brutal and opportunistic public style." <i>No One Left to Lie To</i> is the story of a man who took the Democratic presidential nomination and, having achieved office, began enacting welfare reform and anticrime legislation that surpassed the ambitions of all but the most ideologically loyal Republicans--and routinely plundered the GOP platform for other policy ideas as well.<p> Hitchens is particularly damning on Clinton's tendency to resort to divisive racial politics when it suits his purposes, as when, in the course of the 1992 presidential campaign, he refused to lift a finger to save a mentally retarded African American from state execution so he could appear tough on crime, then shortly afterwards hijacked a Rainbow Coalition conference to criticize rap artist Sister Souljah for the benefit of the attendant press. When he needs the black vote, though, Clinton will allow himself to be trumpeted as the most racially sensitive president in American history--if not, in Toni Morrison's memorably ludicrous phrase, "our first black president." Furthermore, the man who once connived his way out of the draft has become a chief executive so willing to use military air strikes as a means of foreign policy that, in the author's view, the United States is now a "potential banana republic."</p><p> Of course, there is plenty of vitriol directed at Clinton's conduct with regard to Monica Lewinsky (the woman with whom he admitted, under duress, to having had an "inappropriate relationship" consisting of multiple incidences of oral sex) and Kathleen Willey (who alleges that the leader of the free world merely fondled her breasts and forced her to touch--albeit shielded under some layers of clothing--his tumescent penis). In Hitchens's view, however, the sexual controversies are only the most prominent aspect of Clinton's shameful character, a moral condition that must be considered in toto. The book is short, with an argument that runs only about a hundred pages, but that's still more than enough room for Hitchens to serve up a comprehensive, blistering indictment suffused throughout by his dark wit. He sums up the failure of those fixated on Clinton's adultery to fully investigate his cronyism and financial shenanigans: "It's not the lipstick traces, stupid," Hitchens warns, "it's the Revlon Connection." <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><b>Christopher Hitchens</b> is a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i> and the author of the best-selling <i>God Is Not Great</i>.

Upon her arrival in the Jamestown settlement, she is promptly sold into indentured servitude and forced to work in a glasshouse. There, Merry works under the tutelage of kindly Franz, the master glassblower. A mystery ensues when someone begins to sabotage the operation and tries to steal the formula for cristallo, a valuable clear glass from Italy. The historical descriptions of Jamestown and especially glassblowing are detailed and lively enough to hold readers' interest. While the mystery element is somewhat predictable, it adds another level to the historical detail.

And why not? The Magic Kingdom of Landover, which he ruled as High Lord, was finally at peace, and he and his wife, the sylph Willow, could watch their daughter Mistaya grow.<br>And grow she did--shooting through infancy in months, learning to walk and to swim in the same week. Mistaya had been born a seedling, nourished by soils from Landover, Earth, and the fairy mists, come into being in the dank, misty deadness of the Deep Fell. With dazzling green eyes that cut to the soul, she was as lovely as her mother, and Ben wanted nothing more than to enjoy his daughter's childhood and his peaceful kingdom forever. But his idyll was interrupted when Rydall, a king of lands beyond the fairy mist, assembled armies on Landover's border and threatened to invade unless Ben was able to defeat Rydall's seven champions.<br>Some counseled the High Lord to refuse Rydall's challenge, but Holiday could not, for Mistaya had been snatched from her guardians by foul magic. And Rydall held the key to her fate...</p><p>Terry Brooks published his first novel, The Sword of Shannara, in 1977. It was a New York Times bestseller for more than six months. He has published twenty-five New York Times bestsellers since. Two of those--the novels Running with the Demon and A Knight of the Word--were chosen by the Rocky Mountain News (Denver) as among the best fantasy novels of the twentieth century. A practicing lawyer until his third book was published, Brooks now writes full-time. He lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife, Judine.Picking up where The Tangle Box left off, Brooks continues his increasingly convoluted narrative, again following the trials and tribulations of former lawyer?and currently Landover's ruler?Ben Holiday. Even as Holiday battles evil forces to keep his domain secure and his loved ones safe, his daughter, Mistaya, is kidnapped by his nemesis, the disgruntled witch Nightshade. Threatened by the mysterious Rydall, King of the Marnhull, Holiday must prepare to meet seven potentially deadly challenges. Meanwhile, his faithful sidekicks, Abernathy the scribe and Questor Thews the wizard, are sent to Earth, where Abernathy renews his acquaintance with Elizabeth, now an attractive teenager. Despite entertaining passages (Mistaya's training in witchcraft) and moments of depth (Holiday's struggles with his inner demons), the novel still feels cobbled together, a kind of prelude for the romances and battles of later installments. Fortunately, the familiar characters remain as appealing as when they first appeared, despite their involvement in these transparent and hackneyed situations. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Russia House</h2><p>World powers clash for dominance as a beautiful Russian woman carries out a staggering mission and a derelict English publisher becomes the unlikely recipient of the Soviet Union&#39;s top defense secret</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesThe same 3-hour quality performance for less<br><br>2 cassettes / 3 hours<br>Read by the Author<br>Only $8.99<br><br>From premier spy novelist John le Carre, a magnificent thriller, a love story and an ethical puzzle for our time.<br><br>We are in the third year of perestroika and glasnost.&nbsp;&nbsp;The place is Moscow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is Barley; a derelict, English publisher with a passion for jazz and a penchant for booze, who visits the Moscow Book Fair.<br><br>The woman is Katya: a beautiful Russian with a mission to mankind and access to some of the hottest defense intelligence to come out of the Soviet Union in years.&nbsp;&nbsp;It source: a disillusioned and desperate Russian physicist who wants Barley to publish the secrets . . but the British Secret Service and the CIA have other ideas.</p><h2>The Joy of Rhubarb: The Versatile Summer Delight (Fruits &amp; Favorites Cookbooks)</h2><p>Rhubarb&#x2019;s sweetly old-fashioned stalk, with a pucker-sour side, tastes like summer.

She wrote successful cookbooks on muffins, brownies, pies, cookies, cheesecake, casseroles, and several on Cajun cooking. She cooked on television&nbsp;and contributed many recipes to food articles throughout the U.S.A.<p>This book includes recipes from soup (Cold Strawberry-Rhubarb Soup) to nuts (Walnut Rhubarb Chutney). </p><p>There's more to rhubarb than pie BY SUE STORY TRUAX, WORLD-HERALD STAFF WRITER </p><p>"The Joy of Rhubarb" is the latest work from veteran cookbook writer Theresa Millang. Like the previous books from the Kearney, Neb.-based writer, "Rhubarb" is packed with doable recipes. As anyone who has cooked with rhubarb might expect, desserts dominate the recipes, filling pages 17 through 160. Several other chapters not classified as desserts - muffins, breads, sauces, jams and jellies - also produce sweet results. </p><p>Many of the uses will be familiar to cooks who previously have worked with pie plant. There are 28 pie recipes, for example, in the book, subtitled "The Versatile SummerFruit." There are some new-comer recipes, too, such as Strawberry- Rhubarb Tiramisu, Rhubarb Sorbet and Rhubarb Iced Tea. Among the most interesting are the savory uses. These include Rhubarb Ketchup, Jalapeno Rhubarb Chutney, Rhubarb-Glazed Baby Back Ribs and Duck Breast With Rhubarb Sauce. </p><p>The book lacks photos, index and glossary. Four pages at the book's start cover facts, how to grow rhubarb, and tips on storing and freezing. Overall, the recipes are written for experienced cooks. But a thinking beginner should have success, too. </p><p>A vegetarian colleague prepared the following main-dish recipe from the book. He reports that it was delicious. He had worked with lentils before, so he knew to pick them over and wash them before using. It's a good thing he knew because the recipe, as printed in the book, neglected to tell him so. We have added that step in our directions. He used honey as the sweetener. He also suggests using less than the teaspoon of hot red chili powder the recipe calls for. This was his first time cooking with rhubarb. He found what us experienced rhubarb cooks know: cooking breaks down rhubarb to almost a liquid. --Sue Story Traux"Omaha World-Hearld" (05/19/2004)<br><br>MARY ANN GASSMAN, F00D COLUMNIST mgassman@wcINET.COM 563/588-5652 OR 800/553-4801 Get your veggies in a variety of ways 'Joy of Rhubarb' adds to the list of uses for the versatile food When Mom scolded you to eat your vegetables when you were growing up, you might have turned up your nose at the peas, beans and broccoli. But it probably didn't take much coaxing to get you to eat the rhubarb pie. Yes, rhubarb is a vegetable. Rhubarb didn't gain popularity until the early 1880s, when it was used mostly for pies and wine. Rich in vitamin C, dietary fiber and calcium, rhubarb has many uses besides pie and wine. But, for as versatile as the vegetable is, the leaves are not. They are loaded with oxalic acid and are poisonous. The luscious red stalks often are thought of as a fruit because they are used to make such things as cobblers, cakes, bars, strudels, cookies, breads, puddings, sauces, sorbets, parfaits, tiramisu, custards, yogurts, ice creams, tarts, muffins, relishes, chutney, soups, salads, salsas, pickles, jams and a host of other delectable dishes. If you doubt for one moment that it can be used for all those dishes, the proof is on the pages of a little green cookbook just out called, "The Joy of Rhubarb - The Versatile Summer Delight" by Theresa Millang. So, if you're stumped for ways to use your rhubarb - in season through July - get a copy of the book by calling 800/678-7006. It sells for $12.95, plus $2 for shipping &amp; handling. Personal checks and major credit cards are accepted.--Mary Ann Gassman"Telegraph Herald" (05/12/2004)<br><br>BOOK review Book: The Joy of Rhubarb Author: Theresa Millang Publisher: Adventure Publications, $12.95 Cookbook author shares 'Joy' of rhubarb By Myrna Collins Post-Crescent staff writer Just in time for the start of the rhubarb harvest comes Theresa Millang's 245-page book, "The Joy of Rhubarb: The Versatile Summer Delight." About two-thirds of the book is devoted to sweets of one type or another, from pies and tarts to cakes, trifles, bettys, cheesecakes, crumbles, bars and many more. Some are combinations that beg to be tested, just to see if they really work, like rhubarb and coconut, rhubarb and chocolate and rhubarb and zucchini. What surprisingly is missing is the most simple and basic two-crust plain rhubarb pie. But more interesting from an adventures in eating standpoint than the recipes for sweets are the rest of the recipes. Millang segues from muffins to breads, main meals, soups, salads, beverages, sauces, condiments, jams and jelly and finally marmalades, conserves and preserves. All of the recipes are easily made and most specify either fresh or frozen rhubarb.--Myrna Collins"The Post Cresent" (05/19/2004)<br><br>WHAT'S COOKING Here's what s new - or at least new to us - and notable in the world of cookbooks: FRUIT, ETC. For those who enjoy rhubarb, by all means pick up Theresa Millang's "The Joy of Rhubarb" ($12.95, Adventure Publications). More than 200 recipes and not all of them are dessert -will have you using all your rhubarb, and your neighbor's too. There are the old standbys, such as cobblers, crisps, cakes and jams, but also ice cream, soups and salads. Dishes such as rhubarb-glazed baby back ribs provide a nice, tart change of pace.--Nicole Hvidsten"Star Tribune" (06/07/2004)<br><br>Rhubarb: It's not just for pie anymore Well, the mushrooms seemed to have gone kaput this year. But, we do have rhubarb still growing io the garden. And, just in time came a delightful cookbook all about the fruit. "The Joy of Rhubarb" is a new spiral-bound cookbook by Theresa Millang who challenges: "People need help expanding their creative thoughts beyond Rhubarb Crisp.: To answer that challenge, she has provided 200 recipes in the 245-page book which, by the way, is a nice size for plopping down on the counter to follow a recipe. "The Joy of Rhubarb" will convince you, she says, that the "old pie plant' is not just for pie anymore. She says the cookbook offers recipes that put new zip into main meals, soups, salads and even ice cream. There are rhubarb recipes for breads and muffins, jams and jellies, pickles, chutney, relish and sauces, rhubarb punch, lemonade and iced tea. Try Pear-Rhubarb Cobbler, Rhubarb-Raspberry Ice Cream, Grilled Chicken with Rhubarb Relish or Rhubarb Slush Punch. Millang also tells you how to grow, choose, prepare and store rhubarb. In our own rhubarb patch, my favorite gardener carefully picks some of the slender ruby-colored stalks as soon as he can each spring to make his favorite - rhubarb pie. We use caution since we don't have many plants after a relative nearly cleaned us out a few years ago. I prefer Rhubarb Crisp - yum! Bernie's sister-in-law used to like the rhubarb custard pie. She also would make several pies to freeze for relatives living in Arizona. What many former Ottumwans' are to loose meat sandwiches, Bernie's aunt and uncle, Grace and Marshall, were to rhubarb pies - he especially craved them, and Carole was good to make them. I like making pies. But after eating one slice, that's usually all I want. Bernie is not too good with leftovers, but he will scrap the rhubarb pie plate clean in few days. Of course, his mom used it a spring tonic, if you know what I mean. I did try her dandelion greens once; not bad. According to Adventure Publications, "The Joy of Rhubarb is available in bookstores and gift stores. Or, you can write them at 820 Cleveland St. Cambridge, MN 55008. Or, call 1-800-678-7006. What I like about rhubarb that it's easy to grow, easy to pick and clean. Then just put stalks into the food processor and you've got, your slices' for stewing or baking. I've made freezer jam gelatin a time or two, and the slices freeze very well whe you're hungry for rhubarb pie and it's only February. Millang has written sever cookbooks. "Great Minneso. Hotdish" and "Joy of Blueberries" are popular ones.--Judy Krieger"The Ottumwa Courier" (05/26/2004)<br><br></p><p>"The Joy of Rhubarb" by Theresa Millang </p><p>Adventure Publications, Inc. $12.95 </p><p>Several weeks ago I received two cookbooks in the mail "The Joy of Rhubarb" and "Beer is NOT a Food Group," both from Adventure Publications in Cambridge. After looking through both books, they sat on my counter for several weeks. The limited sun in my garden is devoted to basil and tomatoes. I don't have room to grow rhubarb and neither do any of my neighbors. </p><p>After mentioning my lack of rhubarb to a gardener from Norway Lake, she gave me a large bag and I spent a rainy Sunday trying rhubarb recipes. The book has a great selection of the usual recipes - cobblers, crisps, pies and desserts. Several of the main meals paired with rhubarb sounded great, including "Grilled Chicken with Rhubarb Relish" and "Pork with Rhubarb Chutney." There is a recipe for rhubarb tea and rhubarb wine, along with 10 sauce recipes like "Blueberry-Rhubarb Breakfast Sauce." </p><p>I chose to bake both "Rhubarb Tea Bread" and "Applesauce-Rhubarb Cake," along with making "Walnut Rhubarb Chutney" and "Rhubarb Pickles." The bread recipe made two loaves and was moist and comparable to any zucchini bread with the nuts, but with an occasional tartness from the rhubarb. The cake was quick and easy to put together. It was a moist cake, but really more like a nut bread, not like cake. Both recipes took about an hour to bake. </p><p>The chutney and pickles were both quick to make, but both will only keep about a week, although the chutney can be frozen. Both called for fresh ginger and apple cider vinegar. I liked the chutney and had made it because the recipe said to "serve with cheese and French bread or crackers." The pickles left alot to be desired and will probably enrich the compost pile. --Donna Middleton"West Central Tribune" (06/01/2004)</p></p><h2>I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s Food Storage</h2><p>Do you have a three-month supply of food for your family?

Perhaps it&#x2019;s the rugged terrain, beautiful scenery, or vast natural landscape that appeals to you. Or maybe you&#x2019;re just a lunatic who wants to survive in a lifeless barren wasteland. Whatever your reasons, there are a few things you should know:</p> <p><b>1: You&#x2019;re going to need a pressure vessel.</b></p> <p>Mars&#x2019;s atmospheric pressure is less than one percent of Earth&#x2019;s. So basically, it&#x2019;s nothing. Being on the surface of Mars is almost the same as being in deep space. You better bring a nice, sturdy container to hold air in. By the way, this will be your home forever. So try to make it as big as you can.</p> <p><b>2: You&#x2019;re going to need oxygen.</b></p> <p>You probably plan to breathe during your stay, so you&#x2019;ll need to have something in that pressure vessel. Fortunately, you can get this from Mars itself. The atmosphere is very thin, but it is present and it&#x2019;s almost entirely carbon dioxide. There are lots of ways to strip the carbon off carbon dioxide and liberate the oxygen. You could have complex mechanical oxygenators or you could just grow some plants. </p> <p><b>3: You&#x2019;re going to need radiation shielding. </b></p> <p>Earth&#x2019;s liquid core gives it a magnetic field that protects us from most of the nasty crap the sun pukes out at us. Mars has no such luxury. All kinds of solar radiation gets to the surface. Unless you&#x2019;re a fan of cancer, you&#x2019;re going to want your accommodations to be radiation-shielded. The easiest way to do that is to bury your base in Martian sand and rocks. They&#x2019;re not exactly in short supply, so you can just make the pile deeper and deeper until it&#x2019;s blocking enough. </p> <p><b>4: You&#x2019;re going to need water. </b></p> <p>Again, Mars provides. The Curiosity probe recently discovered that Martian soil has quite a lot of ice in it. About 35 liters per cubic meter. All you need to do is scoop it up, heat it, and strain out the water. Once you have a good supply, a simple distillery will allow you to reuse it over and over. </p> <p><b>5: You&#x2019;re going to need food. </b></p> <p>Just eat Martians. They taste like chicken. </p> <p><b>6: Oh, come on. </b></p> <p>All right, all right. Food is the one thing you need that can&#x2019;t be found in abundance on Mars. You&#x2019;ll have to grow it yourself. But you&#x2019;re in luck, because Mars is actually a decent place for a greenhouse. The day/night cycle is almost identical to Earth&#x2019;s, which Earth plants evolved to optimize for. And the total solar energy hitting the surface is enough for their needs. </p> <p>But you can&#x2019;t just grow plants on the freezing, near-vacuum surface. You&#x2019;ll need a pressure container for them as well. And that one might have to be pretty big. Just think of how much food you eat in a year and imagine how much space it takes to grow it. </p> <p>Hope you like potatoes. They&#x2019;re the best calorie yield per land area.</p> <p><b>7: You&#x2019;re going to need energy. </b></p> <p>However you set things up, it won&#x2019;t be a self-contained system. Among other things, you&#x2019;ll need to deal with heating your home and greenhouse. Mars&#x2019;s average daily temperature is -50C (-58F), so it&#x2019;ll be a continual energy drain to keep warm. Not to mention the other life support systems, most notably your oxygenator. And if you&#x2019;re thinking your greenhouse will keep the atmosphere in balance, think again. A biosphere is far too risky on this scale. </p> <p><b>8: You&#x2019;re going to need a reason to be there. </b></p> <p>Why go out of your way to risk your life? Do you want to study the planet itself? Start your own civilization? Exploit local resources for profit? Make a base with a big death ray so you can address the UN while wearing an ominous mask and demand ransom? Whatever your goal is, you better have it pretty well defined, and you better really mean it. Because in the end, Mars is a harsh, dangerous place and if something goes wrong you&#x2019;ll have no hope of rescue. Whatever your reason is, it better be worth it. </p>ANDY WEIR was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since.

Using the Frank Capra Archives, her well-written, readable text is brimming with materials and memorabilia, including the complete final script, reviews, work schedules, etc. New interviews by Leonard Maltin with James Stewart and cinematographer Joseph Biroc provide an up-to-date perspective. One flaw is the lack of an index. This enjoyable book is for movie fans and especially for devotees of Capra, Stewart, and the film itself. Recommended for public libraries.

Set in Botswana in the days before the end of apartheid, Norman Rush's novel is, essentially, a comedy of manners played out in Austen's approved milieu: a country village. Granted, the village in question, Tsau, is a utopian society created by the great American anthropologist Nelson Denoon, and run largely by and for disenfranchised and abused African women. Still, the issue that interests Rush (and the one that fueled Austen's novels) is the age-old question of who mates with whom, and why? The unnamed narrator is a 32-year-old postgraduate student in anthropology whose dissertation has just gone south on her. Drifting around the edges of the expatriate community in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, she first meets Denoon: <blockquote> He was smiling at Kgosetlemang--the event was to be considered over with, clearly--and I could tell that his gingivae were as good as mine; which is saying a lot. I attend to my gums. People in the bush don't always attend to their oral hygiene, not to mention other niceties. There was no sign of that here. I of course am fanatical about my gums because my idea of what the movie <i>I Wake Up Screaming</i> is about is a woman who has to keep dating to find her soulmate and she's had to get dentures. I have very long-range anxieties. </blockquote> Entranced by this potential soulmate, our heroine strikes out into the Kalahari Desert with a couple of donkeys and follows him to his utopia where sexual attraction, regional politics, and social experimentation make for very strange bedfellows, indeed. <p> <i>Mating</i> is a fiercely intelligent, hugely ambitious novel that takes on feminism, socialism, political corruption, foreign-sponsored rural development projects, and, yes, male-female relations in ways that are simultaneously hilarious and disturbing. Certainly Rush's language is a big part of what makes the novel work: the narrator's combination of elevated vocabulary and wacky non sequiturs is inspired. When, for example, Denoon explains to her that most of the women in Tsau are celibate and therefore so is he, she reflects that "of course the spiritus rector of a female community would need to be a sexual solitary, at least during the foundational period." She then wonders if "this situation was the analog of western series on television where the female watchership shrank to nothing when the producers let the marshal get married." <i>Mating</i> is remarkable for its wit, its acuity, and its ability to satirize without demeaning; it's also a heck of an entertaining story. Jane Austen would have been proud. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Norman Rush</b>&nbsp;is the author of four works of fiction:&nbsp;<i>Whites</i>, a collection of stories, and three novels, <i>Subtle Bodies, Mating,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mortals.</i>&nbsp;His stories have appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Paris Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Best American Short Stories</i>.&nbsp;<i>Mating</i>&nbsp;was the recipient of the National Book Award. Rush and his wife live in Rockland County, New York.</p><h2>Turner</h2><p><strong>The innocence of the eye</strong> &nbsp; As a blind person would see the world if the gift of sight suddenly returned - so might one describe the effect of Turner&#x2019;s paintings on the observer. John Ruskin, the uncompromising nineteenth-century defender of the painting of William Turner (1775-1851) spoke of the &#x2019;innocence of the eye&#x2019;, which perceived the colours and forms of the world before it recognized their significance.<br> <br> But in order to develop such a style, Turner first had to overcome the entire legacy of late rococo academic teachings. He was simultaneously a romantic and a realist - and yet he was neither. His landscapes, far in advance of their time, have been called forerunners of Impressionism, but they also possess traits that influenced Expressionism, and many of his late compositions are thoroughly surrealistic.<br> <br> In reality, Turner&#x2019;s art cannot be comprehended by such classifications: its essence remains a riddle to art history even today. For his work arises from a unique relation to the nature that it depicts: through his brilliant sketches, he found his way already in the 19th century to a rigorously open kind of painting in which nature sets free the use of colour. And through the workings of the natural elements - especially atmospheric light - Turner confronted nature at the point where nature itself is an image.<br> <br> This book provides the understandings necessary to open up Turner&#x2019;s paintings for the eye, demonstrating that Turner was not simply illustrating nature, but that his pictures speak directly to the eye as nature does itself - through a world of light and colour. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art Series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 colour illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Michael Bockem�hl (b. 1943) studied art history, philosophy and ecclesiastical history in Munich and Bochum.

Alongside Joseph Brodsky's words of praise one might mention the more concrete honors that the renowned poet Derek Walcott has received: a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship; the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry; the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br> <i>The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948</i>&#x2013;<i>2013</i> draws from every stage of the poet's storied career. Here are examples of his very earliest work, like "In My Eighteenth Year," published when the poet himself was still a teenager; his first widely celebrated verse, like "A Far Cry from Africa," which speaks of violence, of loyalties divided in one's very blood; his mature work, like "The Schooner Flight" from <i>The Star-Apple Kingdom</i>; and his late masterpieces, like the tender "Sixty Years After," from the 2010 collection <i>White Egrets.</i><br><i> </i>Across sixty-five years, Walcott grapples with the themes that have defined his work as they have defined his life: the unsolvable riddle of identity; the painful legacy of colonialism on his native Caribbean island of St. Lucia; the mysteries of faith and love and the natural world; the Western canon, celebrated and problematic; the trauma of growing old, of losing friends, family, one's own memory. This collection, selected by Walcott's friend the English poet Glyn Maxwell, will prove as enduring as the questions, the passions, that have driven Walcott to write for more than half a century.</p></p><p><p><b>Derek Walcott (1930-2017)</b> was born in St. Lucia, the West Indies, in 1930. His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.</p><p><b>Glyn Maxwell</b> was born in Welwyn Garden City, England. He is the author of several collections of poems, has staged several plays in London and New York, and was the poetry editor of <i>The New Republic</i> from 2001 to 2007. He lives in London.</p><p>&#x201c;Derek Walcott is a natural poet. Walcott, who turned 84 this year, began writing young. His first poem appeared in a local paper when he was 14, and his first volume, <i>25 Poems</i>, was self-published when he was 18. &#x2018;Everyone wants a prodigy to fail,' Rita Dove wrote. &#x2018;It makes our mediocrity more bearable.' Walcott did not fail . . . &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Teju Cole, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Poetry of Derek Walcott</i> . . . [is] a rich and beautiful new selection of [Walcott's] life's work, edited by Glyn Maxwell . . . Language becomes a means of mastering his surroundings, enabling him to gain an almost magical power over the elements; language is more real to him than reality itself . . . These magician's powers are rare enough in twentieth-century poetry. But what is even rarer than the ability is the desire to write, as Walcott does, with such abundance and felicity . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Kirsch, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Few poets can sustain a collection spanning more than 600 pages and weighing over a kilo. Derek Walcott is one of the rare exceptions, and this is his most comprehensive anthology so far. Covering nearly seven decades, it is testament to an extraordinary talent . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;One important element of Walcott's poetry is that it's a political poetry of the anti-repressive variety. He turns what might have been natural contempt for the European marauder into exotic kind of inclusiveness. As a Caribbean man, Walcott's self-awareness--that is to say, his use of traditional poetic meters inherited from English models--helps him, over time, to produce an art that is absolute and unassailable . . ." &#x2015;<i>David Biespiel, The Rumpus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Walcott is a generous writer in every sense. The expansive, celebratory texture of his verse is instantly recognisable. It moves with ease between city and country, between &#x2018;the snow still falling in white words on Eighth Street' and the way &#x2018;Sunshine [...] stirs the splayed shadows of the hills like moths' . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fiona Sampson, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Walcott is a poet we're lucky to have writing. He is someone who has devoted his working life to art, in many senses--art as culture, art as craft and even art on canvas . . . the joy of Walcott's work is that even when he's at his most rambling, he isn't tedious. Taken as a whole, this collection gives us a kind of narrative &#x2013; the story of a poet who is developing even in his eighties, sustained by faith in what poetic forms can do, and the many ways in which those forms can do it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tom Payne, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;From his earliest poems--such as &#x2018;In My Eighteenth Year,' written when he was that age -- Walcott's voice is unornamented but carries a profound moral authority. His style is a synthesis of the influences that made the island: equal parts Shakespeare and slang. Walcott speaks ever as an outsider; the closest he gets to belonging is when he speaks for a country that is no one country . . . &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Arlice Davenport, The Wichita Eagle</i></p></p><h2>Dictionary of the Later New Testament &amp; Its Developments (The IVP Bible Dictionary Series)</h2><p><ul><li>One of the 1998 Academy of Parish Clergy Top Ten Books of the Year</li><li>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today's</em> 1998 Books of the Year</li><li>1998 ECPA Gold Medallion (Reference Works)</li></ul> The third of IVP's critically acclaimed series of dictionaries of the New Testament provides focused study on the often-neglected portions of the New Testament: Acts, Hebrews, the General Epistles and Revelation.

I am not about to tell anyone that a player who lacks physical skills can transform himself overnight into a winner by changing his thinking. If you trust a bad swing, it's still going to produce bad shots. (Though it will produce fewer of them than it will if you don't trust it.) You have to attain a level of physical competence to play well.<br><br>Having said that, though, I believe it's impossible to overestimate the importance of the mind in golf. There is no such thing as "muscle memory." Your muscles have no capacity to remember anything. Memory resides in your head. Therefore, no matter how long you practice a golf swing, no matter how skilled you become at it, your muscles alone can't remember it and execute it when the need arises on the golf course. Your muscles and the rest of your body are controlled by your mind. Unless your mind is functioning well when you play golf, your muscles are going to flounder. If your head is filled with bad thoughts, your scorecard is going to be full of bad strokes.<br><br>I'm not sure, actually, where the body ends and the mind begins, and I don't believe anyone is. I don't know where the soul and the spirit are located in a human being, but I know they exist. I think it's more useful to consider a human being, and a golfer, as a seamless organism. Your golf swing will not work well if it employs only the torso and not the legs. The torso and the legs are part of an integrated system, and all the parts of that system have to function in order to hit a golf ball. In the same way, what we refer to for the sake of convenience as your body and your mind are in reality parts of an integrated system. All the parts of that system must function properly in order to play golf well.<br><br>Golf is a game. It's not a science experiment that can be completed in accordance with immutable physical laws. It's not a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are designed to fit together and yield a perfect picture. It's a game, and it must be played.<br><br>Because it's a game played by human beings on God's green earth, golf is a game of mistakes and unpredictable fortune. If it were not, no one would ever miss a fairway, a green, or a putt. On top of that, there would be no sudden gusts of wind, no unfortunate bounces, no imperfections in the turf. Every ball would go exactly where you wanted it to go, and the winning score in a golf tournament would be something like 50 strokes per round.<br><br>If you truly love golf, you must love the fact that no one shoots 50, that golf is an inherently imperfect game. If you spend your time fighting the fact that golf is a game of mistakes and trying to make it a game of perfect shots, you're really saying that you don't like golf. You want it to be some other game -- billiards, maybe. No one has ever perfected golf -- not Ben Hogan, not Jack Nicklaus, not Annika Sorenstam. I don't believe anyone ever will.<br><br>The players I see trying to force perfection into golf don't look to me as if they're having a very good time. They think that when they finally get the game down perfectly, they'll be recognized and adored for it. I envision them as 90-year-olds, still wondering when the game will come together perfectly. In the meantime, they've played countless rounds with scowls on their faces. They walk off the course looking frightened, unhappy, frustrated -- looking like anything but an individual who's just spent four or five hours playing a beloved game. They look like they've just stepped out of a Siberian prison camp instead of a golf course.<br><br>These might be people who will spend hours talking about how much they love the game. But when they get honest about their feelings, they'll admit that while they might love reading about golf, swapping stories about golf, even practicing golf, they don't actually love playing golf, at least not while they're doing it. After a round, they're still consumed by tension and anxiety. They're unpleasant to be with.<br><br>If this is your attitude toward golf, why would you make it your hobby? Still more, why would you make it your profession?<br><br>Golfers who truly understand and love the game accept it, rather than fight it. They realize that the essence of golf is reacting well to its inevitable mistakes and misfortunes. They know that they can separate themselves from their competition, not by perfecting their games, but by constantly striving to improve and reacting well to mistakes. I remind players that if there's one thing they should always be proud of in their golf games, it's how well they react to mistakes. I tell them that they will never have complete control of the golf ball. But they can control their attitudes.<br><br>The biggest mistake most people make is to respond passively to what happens on the golf course. They let how they play dictate their attitude. If the ball is going where they want it to go, they have a good attitude. If it isn't, their attitude is bad. They start thinking badly. When you're playing well, it's fine to go with the flow. But when you're playing badly, you need the discipline to control your thoughts and think only about the way you want to play.<br><br>Mastering this concept goes a long way in determining two critical outcomes. One is how good a player is going to get at golf. The second is how much fun he'll have along the way.<br><br>Golfers who have fun along the way understand that golf is first a game you play within yourself. You win that game by resisting all the mental temptations and pitfalls I'll be discussing in more detail later in this book. You win it by bringing both your mind and your body to bear on the test of golf as well as you possibly can.<br><br>Golf is the most honest of games in that you can't lie to yourself about how well you're doing in that personal game. The great players I work with are usually brutally honest about what went on in their minds during a round. I sometimes have happy professional clients talk to me after they've shot 75. Of course, they understand that 75 isn't a good score for a professional golfer. But they're happy with the way they played. By "the way they played," I don't mean how many strokes they took. I mean that they're happy with the attitude they maintained during the round, with their concentration, their focus, their thoughts. A player can control those things. He can't control his score.<br><br>Conversely, I've had clients shoot 65 and tell me very candidly that they were exceedingly lucky to do so. It can happen for a round or two. Maybe a player gets good bounces. Maybe he sinks some putts with less-than-trusting strokes because he misread the green. For a round or two, a player might get away with thinking poorly, but he knows that it will catch up with him. So it's quite possible that a player who shot 75 will be cheerfully optimistic about his game, and a player who shot 65 might be concerned.<br><br>I'm particularly impressed when this happens because another part of my philosophy is that a player is not the number at the bottom of his scorecard. A player's worth as a person is not directly correlated to the score he or she shoots. A golfer whose mood and self-esteem are determined by the score he shoots for a given round or tournament has a very superficial approach to both life and golf. On the other hand, a player has to care enough about the scores he shoots to want to practice and improve. Otherwise, he's wasting my time and his money talking to me.<br><br>I want players to understand that while it's important to have dreams and goals in golf, the pleasure comes from chasing those dreams more than it does from catching them. I can't guarantee any player that his dreams will come true. I can't predict when they'll come true. What I can guarantee is that a life spent chasing dreams is a life well spent. Anyone who does this will get to the end of his days and look back with a smile. He will have had a ball. Once a player understands this, it gives him remarkable peace of mind. He can weather the inevitable downs in a game of ups and downs. He doesn't get critical or judgmental about himself. He knows that in the end, things will turn out well. He's an optimist.<br><br>There's a difference between chasing dreams and daydreaming. Daydreamers sit on the couch and think that it would be nice to be winning tournaments, or scoring in the 70s. But they do nothing about it from one round of golf to the next. Consequently, they never improve. There's no satisfaction in that.<br><br>Golf is full of fine lines and balances. The idea that you mustn't define yourself by your golf score, but at the same time must care about it and want to improve it, is one example. Another is the balance between being a sponge and being bullheaded.<br><br>The sponge is a golfer who listens to anyone and everyone who wants to offer advice about his game. One week he's convinced that the action of the hands is the key to greatness. The next week it's the ratio between his shoulder turn and hip turn. Pretty soon, the sponge is so full of conflicting ideas that he can barely start the club back. He's thinking too hard, trying to sort out all the advice he's gotten.<br><br>The bullheaded player doesn't listen to anyone. He's uncoachable. He's been doing it a particular way for a long time and he likes doing it that way, even if he rarely breaks 90.<br><br>A successful golfer has to find a balance between the two extremes. You have to be true to your unique personality and skills, to relish the quirks that set you apart from others. You've got to love doing things your way. You have to love your talent and your game more than you love anyone else's. But you have to be amenable to improving your game. To be a great golfer, it's very important that you're self-reliant and have the ability to function independently, make decisions for yourself, and trust your instincts. But in order to get to greatness, you're going to have to surround yourself with some good people, people who will offer advice and help. On the amateur level it might be a club pro whom you respect, and trust, and make the only teacher you listen to for help on your swing. On the professional level it might be Butch Harmon or David Leadbetter. You're going to have to learn that there's a time to listen to such people and a time to be self-reliant. You'll have to learn the difference.<br><br>You must take responsibility for the talent you have. I dislike it when someone says to me, "I don't have the talent to be No. 1." I dislike it just as much when someone says he hasn't got the talent to win his club championship or to have a single-digit handicap, or to break 90. The fact is, we don't know exactly how much talent anyone has. Talent is a mixture of physical and mental qualities that is immeasurable. When people think of golf talent, they think of Annika Sorenstam. But I don't know how physically talented Annika is. It's no knock on her to observe that I don't know of any other sport she's great at. She's great at golf because she devoted her time and energy to it, obviously. Whether she could have gotten great at any other endeavor is something we may never learn.<br><br>The question is not whether you have great talent, because we'll never answer that definitively. The question is whether you're willing to put in the time and energy to develop the talent you have. Sometimes a player will tell me that "If I had Tiger's (or Phil's or Davis's) talent to go along with my attitude, I'd be awesome." I always disagree. I disagree because I believe a great attitude includes loving your talent above anyone else's. It's part of the foundation of a great attitude. <br><br>You must also find a balance in your life. I know very few people who manage to keep their lives in any sort of rigid, systematic balance. I smile when someone tells me he's got his life broken down into blocks: eight hours for sleep, eight hours for work, four hours for family, three hours for golf, and maybe an hour for working out. Real people are always out of balance in some way. Maybe one month they're so immersed in work that they don't find enough time for their families, their golf, their fitness. But they recognize the imbalance and correct it the next month. Maybe the period of imbalance is much longer -- measured in years, rather than weeks or months. It's fine for an aspiring professional to devote five, seven, or ten years to improving his golf game and establishing himself on the Tour, almost to the exclusion of all else. But at some point, the balance must be redressed.<br><br>On the golf course, there's a fine line between playing to play great and playing recklessly. A reckless player hits his driver off virtually every tee. He fires at sucker pins he has no business aiming at because he's convinced that's what playing to play great is all about. It isn't. A player who's playing to play great loves a great drive more than he fears the rough. He likes making putts more than he cares about three-putting. He loves chipping it in more than he loathes not getting up and down. But he may have a conservative strategy for certain holes. The conservative strategy is what permits him to always make a confident, even cocky swing. When the moment is right, when he's got a scoring club in his hands, he takes dead aim at the hole. But only when the moment is right.<br><br>The player who plays to play great understands that good can be the enemy of great. He knows that if he gets too concerned about not being bad, he might not free himself up enough to be great. He doesn't care very much about making cuts or Top 20 finishes. He plays to win.<br><br>If he does this, he controls his destiny as a golfer. I want clients to understand this. They have free will. The choices they make with that free will determine the quality of their golf game and the quality of their lives. If you consistently make the right choices, you're destined for greatness. I'm not suggesting that this necessarily means you're going to win all the Grand Slam tournaments or all your club events, or even all your Saturday morning Nassaus. I'm saying that if you make the right choices, you will someday look back on your life, or that part of your life that was devoted to golf, and say, "Wow! That was great."<br><br><b>Thoughts to Play By<br><br>Golf is a game, and it must be played.<br><br>Let your mind control the ball. Don't let the ball control your mind.

He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote. ASTERIX THE GAUL, their first album, was published in 1961 and there have now been 35 Asterix albums.A cartoon drawn with such supreme artistry, and a text layered with such glorious wordplay, satire and historical and political allusion that no reader should ever feel like they've outgrown it.&#x2015;<b>TIME OUT</b><br><br>The Asterix books represent the very summit of our achievement as a literary race.

He was over fifty when his first book of stories about life as a Yorkshire vet was published, giving birth to some of Yorkshire&#39;s most famous and much-loved literary characters. Although he brought fame and fortune to himself and those around him, Alf Wight remained an intensely private person, respected and trusted by those whose animals he cared for, and adored by millions of fans. This illuminating biography reveals the real man behind the title &#39;The World&#39;s Most Famous Vet&#39;.</p><p>No one is better poised to write the biography of James Herriot than the son who worked alongside him in the Yorkshire veterinary practice when Herriot became an internationally bestselling author. Now, in this warm and poignant memoir, Jim Wight talks about his father--the beloved veterinarian whom his family had to share with half the world. <br> <br>Alf Wight (aka James Herriot) grew up in Glasgow, where he lived during a happy rough-and-tumble childhood and then through the challenging years of training at the Glasgow Veterinary College. The story of how the young vet later traveled to the small Yorkshire town of Thirsk, aka Darrowby, to take the job of assistant vet is one that is well known through James Herriot's internationally celebrated books and the popular All Creatures Great and Small television series. <br> <br>But Jim Wight's biography ventures beyond the trials and tribulations of his father's life as a veterinarian to reveal the man behind the stories--the private individual who refused to allow fame and wealth to interfere with his practice or his family. With access to all of his father's papers, correspondence, manuscripts, and photographs--and intimate remembrances of all the farmers, locals, and friends who populate the James Herriot books--only Jim Wight could write this definitive biography of the man who was not only his father but his best friend. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>JIM WIGHT took time out from the veterinary practice in Thirsk, where he worked with his father for many years, in order to write and then publicise this book. He lives just outside Thirsk in North Yorkshire.</p><h2>Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In</h2><p><p><b>The<i> New York Times </i>bestseller!</b></p><p>When Bernie Sanders began his race for the presidency, it was considered by the political establishment and the media to be a &#x201c;fringe&#x201d; campaign, something not to be taken seriously. After all, he was just an Independent senator from a small state with little name recognition. His campaign had no money, no political organization, and it was taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment. </p><p>By the time Sanders&#x2019;s campaign came to a close, however, it was clear that the pundits had gotten it wrong. Bernie had run one of the most consequential campaigns in the modern history of the country. He had received more than 13 million votes in primaries and caucuses throughout the country, won twenty-two states, and more than 1.4 million people had attended his public meetings. Most important, he showed that the American people were prepared to take on the greed and irresponsibility of corporate America and the 1 percent.</p><p>In <i>Our Revolution,</i> Sanders shares his personal experiences from the campaign trail, recounting the details of his historic primary fight and the people who made it possible. And for the millions looking to continue the political revolution, he outlines a progressive economic, environmental, racial, and social justice agenda that will create jobs, raise wages, protect the environment, and provide health care for all&#x2015;and ultimately transform our country and our world for the better. For him, the political revolution has just started. The campaign may be over, but the struggle goes on.</p></p><p>BERNIE SANDERS ran as a Democratic candidate for President of the United States in 2015 and 2016. He served as mayor of Burlington, Vermont&#x2019;s largest city, for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991. He was elected to the Senate in 2007 and is now in his second term, making him the longest-serving independent in the history of the Congress.

This unequal ratio explains not only why it&#x2019;s so hard to find a date, but a host of social issues, from the college hookup culture to the reason Salt Lake City is becoming the breast implant capital of America. Then there&#x2019;s the math that says that a woman&#x2019;s good looks can keep men from approaching her&#x2014;particularly if they feel the odds aren&#x2019;t in their favor.<br><br> Fortunately, there are also solutions: what college to attend (any with strong sciences or math), where to hang out (in New York, try a fireman&#x2019;s bar), where to live (Colorado, Seattle, &#x201c;Man&#x201d; Jose), and why never to shy away from giving an ultimatum.<br> &nbsp;</p><br></p><p>It&#x2019;s not that he&#x2019;s just not that into you&#x2014;it&#x2019;s that there aren&#x2019;t enough of him. And the numbers prove it. Using a combination of demographics, statistics, game theory, and number crunching, <i>Date-onomics</i> tells what every college-educated, heterosexual, looking-for-a-partner single woman needs to know: The &#x201c;man defecit&#x201d; is real.

Van Buren, a native Dutch speaker, was America's first ethnic president as well as the first New Yorker to hold the office, at a time when Manhattan was bursting with new arrivals. A sharp and adroit political operator, he established himself as a powerhouse in New York, becoming a U.S. senator, secretary of state, and vice president under Jackson, whose election he managed. His ascendancy to the Oval Office was virtually a foregone conclusion.</p><p>Once he had the reins of power, however, Van Buren found the road quite a bit rougher. His attempts to find a middle ground on the most pressing issues of his day-such as the growing regional conflict over slavery-eroded his effectiveness. But it was his inability to prevent the great banking panic of 1837, and the ensuing depression, that all but ensured his fall from grace and made him the third president to be denied a second term. His many years of outfoxing his opponents finally caught up with him.</p><p>Ted Widmer, a veteran of the Clinton White House, vividly brings to life the chaos and contention that plagued Van Buren's presidency-and ultimately offered an early lesson in the power of democracy.</p><br><p>" ... Widmer (<i>Young America</i>) paints a brief but elegant portrait of our eighth president, who, Widmer says, created the modern political party system, for which he deserves our 'grudging respect.' " - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p><p><b>Ted Widmer </b>is the director of the C. V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience at Washington College. He is the author of <i>Young America</i> and the co-author, with Alan Brinkley, of <i>Campaigns</i>. Widmer served as senior adviser to President Clinton and director of speechwriting at the National Security Council. He lives in Maryland.</p>In the latest volume of Arthur Schlesinger's American Presidents series, Widmer (<i>Young America</i>) paints a brief but elegant portrait of our eighth president, who, Widmer says, created the modern political party system, for which he deserves our "grudging respect." Andrew Jackson's successor, Martin Van Buren (1782&#x2013;1862) was also at various times Jackson's secretary of state, ambassador to the Court of St. James's and vice president. As Widmer relates, some newspapermen called the New York Democrat "the little magician" because of his diminutive frame and his deftness at political sleight of hand. Others&#x2014;who criticized his response when the American economy ground to a halt shortly after his election in 1836&#x2014;called him "Martin Van Ruin." Despite the collapse of financial markets in 1837, Van Buren held fast to his belief in the Jacksonian principles of limited federal government, states' rights and protection of the "people" from the "powerful." This led him to reject calls for a national bank and an independent treasury. Throughout his term, Van Buren effectively took no federal action to alleviate the economic crisis. Thus it was not surprising when, despite building the Democratic Party into a well-oiled machine, he went down to defeat after just one term, beaten by William Henry Harrison, the Virginian Whig of aristocratic background who posed as a simple rustic. All this Widmer relates powerfully, engagingly and efficiently. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other river craft. But in this delightful story, a young boy befriends a little hippo and together they live out their days along the banks of the Nile. After many years, when the boy&#x2019;s life comes to an end, the hippo finds himself in a strange world populated with deserts, cities, forests, and finally a museum where he is reunited with his friends. Early Egyptian civilization has long been a source of curiosity and fascination for children. Through this simple, moving, and beautifully illustrated story young readers will discover how and why the hippopotamus was such an important figure in that ancient world.</p><p>Geraldine Elschner is the author of nearly 30 books for children, including Where is the Frog? The Cat and the Bird and Funny Machines for George the Sheep (all Prestel). She lives in Germany. Anja C. Klauss has studied at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Strasbourg. She has illustrated several children&#39;s books.K-Gr 3&#x2014;Little Hippo begins this tale as one of many blue hippos who call the Nile home. When his friend, an old man named Antef, dies, Little Hippo travels with him to his tomb and rests beside him. When archaeologists discover the tomb centuries later, Little Hippo is frightened and runs away to find his family. This search ultimately brings him to the Louvre, one of many museums that now house his "family" as beautiful relics from Ancient Egypt. Elschner's use of the blue hippo narrative as a mechanism to tie together modern and ancient times rests on the sturdy backbone provided by Klauss's inspired illustrations. The elements of picture and story work together seamlessly, transcending time to bring readers back to the fertile Nile of ancient Egypt. VERDICT This illustrated history of the blue hippos will first appeal to young readers' visual sensibilities, then give way to an appreciation of this art as a gift to be treasured from a culture long past.&#x2014;Colleen S.

Coleman's great-grandfather asked his two young sons to lift him up and pull out the chair when he hanged himself, and that noose stayed in the family shed for years. The rope was the violent instrument, but it was mental anguish that killed him. Now, in gripping fashion, Coleman examines the ways that the legacies of slavery, war, sharecropping, poverty, and alcoholism mask a family history of mental illness. Those same forces accompanied her into the black religious traditions and Christian ministry. All the while, she wrestled with her own bipolar disorder.</p><br><p><i>Bipolar Faith</i> is both a spiritual autobiography and a memoir of mental illness. In this powerful book, Monica Coleman shares her life-long dance with trauma, depression, and the threat of death. Citing serendipitous encounters with black intellectuals like Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Angela Davis, and Renita Weems, Coleman offers a rare account of how the modulated highs of bipolar II can lead to professional success, while hiding a depression that even her doctors rarely believed. Only as she was able to face her illness was she able to live faithfully with bipolar.</p></p><p>Monica A. Coleman teaches theology and African American religions at Claremont School of Theology, where she also codirects the Center for Process Studies. Her writings cover womanist theology, sexual abuse, and the African American experience. She is an ordained elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church a sought-after speaker and preacher.<p>"A stunning, unforgettable read, <i>Bipolar Faith</i> grabs you with the first exquisitely composed paragraphs and won't let you go until the final page is turned. Even then, its impact lingers. To say this is a book about mental health severely limits its scope, which includes arresting reflections on race, womanhood, death, love, sex, community, and joy. A master storyteller, Coleman seamlessly knits together the personal and universal, the particular and the communal. Hers is one of the clearest and most compelling voices in Christian literature today. Let those with ears hear."<br>Rachel Held Evans, Author of Searching for Sunday and A Year of Biblical Womanhood<br></p><p>"Monica Coleman is a courageous and brilliant theologian whose wisdom and rigor helps sustain many of us. This unique and pioneering book opens a new spiritual zone for our serious attention!"<br>Cornel West, Author of <i>Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism and Race Matter</i><br></p><p>"I'm very excited about Rev. Dr. Monica Coleman's new book, <i>Bipolar Faith</i>.

This will be a helpful resources for pastors and congregants across the country."</p> --Joshua DuBois, Author of <i>The President's Devotional: The Readings that Inspired President Obama</i><br><br>"In <i>Bipolar Faith</i>, Dr. Coleman offers a brilliantly written narrative which provides a bird's-eye view of her early years marked by family strife, tragedy and loss juxtaposed with the joys of childhood summers spent immersed in a segregated black community in Washington, DC. She ushers us gently into her world in which, over time, through Ivy League baccalaureate study and pursuit of ministerial professionalism and spiritual scholarship, she comes to terms with a family history of mental health challenges and substance use disorder, her own traumatic experiences and a diagnosis of mental illness which finally explains her episodic changes in mood, outlook and activity level. The reader will admire Dr. Coleman's strong faith through it all, her existential questioning and the fact that she has emerged whole from introspective exploration, loving herself as is." --Annelle Primm, Senior Psychiatrist Advisor for Urban Behavioral Associates and former Deputy Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Associatio<br><br>"In her memoir, <i>Bipolar Faith</i>, Reverend Dr. Monica Coleman courageously shares the story of her own personal and private life struggles with God, death, loneliness, love, rape and a family history of mental illness. Once a taboo topic, Dr. Coleman's revelation of the need for a middle place to balance the public demands of life and the private pain and isolation of depression helps the church begin the conversation about relevant ministries to meet the needs of our congregants who often find themselves in the dark place of mental illness. Our spiritual journey takes us through light and darkness. This book may help an individual or a congregation to honestly pull back the cover of secrecy to develop resources for hurting people and families. <i>Bipolar Faith</i> shines a light in those seemingly empty periods of darkness." --Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, 117th Elected Bishop, African Methodist Episcopal Church; and Author of <i>Not Without A Struggle, Journey to the Well, Strength in the Struggle</i> and <i>Swapping Housewives</i></p><h2>Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in More than Human Worlds (Volume 41) (Posthumanities)</h2><p><p>To care can feel good, or it can feel bad. It can do good, it can oppress. But what is care? A moral obligation? A burden? A joy? Is it only human? In <i>Matters of Care</i>, Mar�a&nbsp;Puig de la Bellacasa presents a powerful challenge to conventional notions of care, exploring its significance as an ethical and political obligation for thinking in the more than human worlds of technoscience and naturecultures.&nbsp;</p><p>Matters of Care contests the view that care is something only humans do, and argues for extending to non-humans the consideration of agencies and communities that make the living web of care by considering how care circulates in the natural world. The first of the book&#x2019;s two parts, &#x201c;Knowledge Politics,&#x201d; defines the motivations for expanding the ethico-political meanings of care, focusing on discussions in science and technology that engage with sociotechnical assemblages and objects as lively, politically charged &#x201c;things.&#x201d; The second part, &#x201c;Speculative Ethics in Antiecological Times,&#x201d; considers everyday ecologies of sustaining and perpetuating life for their potential to transform our entrenched relations to natural worlds as &#x201c;resources.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>From the ethics and politics of care to experiential research on care to feminist science and technology studies, <i>Matters of Care</i> is a singular contribution to an emerging interdisciplinary debate that expands agency beyond the human to ask how our understandings of care must shift if we broaden the world. &nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Mar�a Puig de la Bellacasa is associate professor in science, technology, and organization at the University of Leicester School of Management.</p><p>"Through its observations and appreciations of the worlds in which many forms of care happen, this bold and synthetic book makes two transforming contributions to contemporary theorizing as it subtly invites everyone to appreciate the centrality of posthuman thinking. Feminists and posthumanists can no longer speak past each other: here&#x2019;s why."&#x2014;Joan C. Tronto, University of Minnesota</p><br><br><p>"Aesthetic analyses such as these would carry the potential to generate care within and for the entanglement of relations to which we all belong, a task that Puig de la Bellacasa&#x2019;s book accomplishes exceptionally well."&#x2014;<i>Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory</i></p><p>"<i>Matters of Care </i>provides us with a theory of transformative change that is not anchored in violence and bloodshed, but in the everyday occurrences of caring with and for. This is a revolutionary book!"&#x2014;<i>Hypatia Reviews</i></p><p>"<i>Matters of Care</i> offers a dive into an always-political ethics that is inspired by agricultural practices and the more-than-human beings wrapped up in them."&#x2014;<i>CENHS</i><br><br> "It offers a serious and thoughtful contribution to debates around the place of politics within posthumanism, connecting a radical openness to human and non-human others with an enduring concern for the excluded and marginal. In doing so it reimagines how we might know the world and places care at the heart of a hybrid practice of knowing, relating to, and sustaining worlds." &#x2014;<i>Society + Space</i><br><br> "Matters of Care feels at once like a new beginning for ethics and politics in more than human worlds, yet also the logical outcome of many years of work in new materialist and feminist thought. It is a masterfully lucid and challenging theoretical exposition in which a feminist ethic of care is extended through speculation on its limits." &#x2014;<i>Journal of Cultural Economy</i><br><br> "Her speculative ethics of care joins together &#x201c;an affective state, a material vital doing, and an ethico-political obligation&#x201d; (42) to imagine how to live in these worlds. The book draws upon and will be of interest to practitioners of science and technology studies, feminist care ethics, and posthumanism, among others." &#x2014;<i>ISLE</i><br><br> "Puig de la Bellacasa&#x2019;s <i>Matters of Care</i> offers a stirring and thoughtful meditation on how to engage in a speculative task and an ethical commitment that brings together humans and more-than-humans." &#x2014;<i>Tapuya</i></p></p><h2>Some Enchanted Eclair (A Magical Bakery Mystery)</h2><p><b>FLOUR POWER</b><br><br>When Hollywood invades Savannah&#x2019;s historic district to film a Revolutionary War movie, magical baker Katie Lightfoot, and her witches&#x2019; coven, the Spellbook Club, take a break from casting spells for casting calls.

I looked up from where I was quickly counting out change for a customer and saw two giggling teenaged girls enter. Their similar features suggested they were sisters, and behind them followed a tired-looking couple I pegged as their parents. The family paused to take in the high ceilings, warm amber walls, and fully occupied blue and chrome bistro sets before shuffling to the back of the line, which was already five deep at the register.</p><p>Uncle Ben, Aunt Lucy, and I had started the bakery more than a year ago, and we&#x2019;d worked hard to develop regular clientele as well as to attract Savannah&#x2019;s tourist trade. The sound of that bell meant customers, and customers meant business, and business was a good thing almost without exception.</p><p>Never mind that Lucy and I were on our own these days, juggling the busy morning rush without Ben&#x2019;s help. Usually he ran the register, chatting with people as if they were his best friends as he took orders and rang up purchases. His natural style combined with genuine interest to make each person feel special. I tried to emulate him, but my mind kept darting back to the kitchen.</p><p>Aunt Lucy cast a harried glance my way before quieting her features and returning her attention to the espresso machine. Two patrons who had already ordered stood near the counter, patiently waiting for their coffee drinks. They nibbled on confections purchased from the brightly lit glass case that was usually packed with all manner of Honeybee pastries, cookies, scones, muffins, and the like. With dismay, I realized the shelves were half-empty.</p><p>Pasting a cheerful smile on my face, I asked the gentleman who was now at the front of the line, &#x201c;And what can we get for you today, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>The man&#x2019;s gaze remained trained on the chalkboard menu on the wall above and behind where I stood. His thinning hair wisped above light eyes in a pale face. He shuffled his feet and jammed his hands deep into the pockets of his Dockers.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you have that&#x2019;s gluten-free?&#x201d; His voice was so soft I could hardly hear him.</p><p>&#x201c;How does a peanut butter cookie sound? Or an apricot-almond tart?&#x201d; I pointed to the clearly listed gluten-free options we&#x2019;d recently added to the menu. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re sweetened with clover honey. Or how about a chunk of peanut butter fudge?&#x201d; I suggested the daily special as an alternative to the items listed behind me.</p><p>He glanced at me with wide eyes before his gaze fell to the floor, and he sighed heavily. &#x201c;Fudge is candy. I don&#x2019;t want candy. What about a corn bread biscuit?&#x201d;</p><p>My cheeks were beginning to hurt from the effort it took to keep smiling. One of the young girls rolled her eyes and said to the other one in a loud voice, &#x201c;This is going to take <i>forever</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kelsey,&#x201d; her mother said without much feeling.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it <i>is</i>.&#x201d; The girl spun around and opened the door. She stuck her head out and looked down the street. Sticky May heat rolled into the air-conditioned seating area, and I bit my tongue as I thought of the electric meter working overtime.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid only those baked items listed under the heading &#x2018;gluten-free&#x2019; are, you know, free of gluten,&#x201d; I said to my customer.</p><p>The tall woman behind him snorted. It was Mrs. Standish, one of our regulars. Today she wore a crimson turban and a swirling white caftan covered with giant Oriental poppies the same color as the headdress. I was perpetually amazed at the bold fashion statements she managed to pull off.</p><p>Lucy moved to my side, the seafoam green of her batik skirt swirling around her slim hips. She&#x2019;d tamed her long gray-blond mop into a thick braid that fell down her back and wore a simple blue chef&#x2019;s apron from my considerable collection.</p><p>&#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;d like the apple-fennel muffins,&#x201d; Lucy said to the wispy man standing in front of the register, and then to Mrs. Standish, &#x201c;Your usual drink, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Mrs. Eagel,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The other people waiting in line appeared relieved at Lucy&#x2019;s efficiency. As my aunt turned, she caught my eye and gave the slightest of winks. <i>Darn it</i>&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been so busy trying to catch up that I&#x2019;d missed the clues from our gluten-intolerant customer. His lack of eye contact, the weighty sigh, all that looking down at the floor, the pained shyness.</p><p>This guy was lonely. Extremely so.</p><p>Lucy had suggested the muffin to him because she knew it contained more than savory-sweet goodness. She was still teaching me about the Craft of hedgewitchery, but by now we regularly worked together to add a bit of green magic to our baked goods&#x2014;a bit of herb there, a sprinkle of spice here, a murmured incantation. Everything that came out of our ovens had a special ingredient no other bakery in town could copy: spells intended to be helpful whenever and wherever they might be needed. My aunt was quite talented at steering people toward exactly the right treat for them on any given day. Our customers might not know why they loved the Honeybee as much as they did, but my pastry school training and our family practice of herbal witchery were a happy combination.</p><p>As we&#x2019;d tinkered with the gluten-free muffin recipe a few weeks before, Lucy had commented, &#x201c;We need apples in this one. After all, who couldn&#x2019;t use more love, peace, and happiness?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Nice tart Granny Smiths. And how about fennel, too? The flavors enhance each other, and it will add a boost of courage.&#x201d;</p><p>But now my customer frowned. &#x201c;That muffin sounds good, but you seem to be out of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; I held up my finger. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t had a chance to restock the case. Give me a sec, and I&#x2019;ll grab some more.&#x201d;</p><p>The teenager&#x2019;s sigh must have been audible clear over on Tybee Island.</p><p>I hurried into the open kitchen at the rear of the bakery. Rounding the big stainless-steel refrigerator, I saw little Mungo peeking around the half-open door of the office. Concern shone from his cocoa brown eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, buddy.&#x201d; I waved the Cairn terrier back toward the club chair where he lazed most days at the Honeybee. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;d help if you could, but you know the rule&#x2014;no dogs in the kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>He panted and grinned up at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Or in the reading area, either. At least not while it&#x2019;s still so busy.&#x201d;</p><p>My familiar huffed his disgruntlement and backed into the other room. I shut the door, piled a plate high with muffins, and quickstepped to the register.</p><p>Mollified, the man paid and left. Mrs. Standish stepped up next. &#x201c;Today I&#x2019;ll take two of those scrumptious red velvet whoopie pies, Katie my dear. Red velvet cake was my dear Harry&#x2019;s favorite.&#x201d; Suddenly, she sighed, and I saw another kind of loneliness in her eyes, the kind that comes from the lingering loss of a loved one. Her husband had died a bit over two years before, but she rarely referred to him. &#x201c;While you&#x2019;re at it, throw in some of those pistachio cream �clairs. Is that toffee on top?&#x201d; Her deep voice rose and fell over the syllables as only a native Savannahian&#x2019;s could.</p><p>Lucy handed her a tall steaming drink with a smile and turned to the next customer in line to get a jump on his order.</p><p>&#x201c;It is indeed.&#x201d; I grabbed a paper bag and slid open the back of the case.</p><p>&#x201c;How is it you two are working alone today?&#x201d; Mrs. Standish asked as I selected one of the ruby-toned whoopie pies filled with homemade coconut marshmallow cream. &#x201c;Where on earth is your uncle?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He and Declan are working security on the movie set over by Reynolds Square.&#x201d; I shook open the bag with the Honeybee logo printed on the side. It was a depiction of Lucy&#x2019;s familiar, an elegant orange tabby cat named, you guessed it, Honeybee.</p><p>When A. Dendum Productions had come to Savannah, Georgia, to film a romantic comedy set during the Revolutionary War, the chief of police had recommended Uncle Ben to head the small security detail intended to keep fans and paparazzi at bay. Ever the loving wife, Lucy had assured Ben that she and I could handle the bakery on our own for a couple of weeks. Since Ben was Savannah&#x2019;s recently retired fire chief, he was immediately hired. His security crew consisted of off-duty firefighters whom he&#x2019;d worked with over the years, including his prot�g�&#x2014;and my boyfriend&#x2014;Declan McCarthy.</p><p>I filled the bag with the requested pastries and handed it to Mrs. Standish. She moved to the side so I could ring up the next order.</p><p>&#x201c;What about your usual helpers?&#x201d; Mrs. Standish was referring to the members of the spellbook club who stepped in to assist in the bakery when needed. She knew the six of us were in a book club, but she didn&#x2019;t know we were an informal coven of witches.</p><p>&#x201c;Over at the set,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Except Cookie, who&#x2019;s still in Europe, and Jaida, who I&#x2019;m pretty sure is in court today.&#x201d; An attorney, Jaida French had a special interest in tarot magic.</p><p>Mrs. Standish snorted again. &#x201c;Bunch of looky-loos. I&#x2019;d expect more decorum from native Southerners.&#x201d; The teenagers&#x2019; father glared at her implied insult to tourists, but Mrs. Standish didn&#x2019;t notice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if filming in Savannah is anything unusual,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been doing it since 1915, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>Lucy spoke up from behind the espresso machine. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re helping out, not standing around gawking. Bianca is even going to be in a couple of scenes.&#x201d; Tall, elegant Bianca Devereaux was a traditionally trained Wiccan and the single mom of seven-year-old Colette.</p><p>&#x201c;Bah.&#x201d; Mrs. Standish waved her mannish hand in the air. &#x201c;She certainly possesses the beauty and bearing to dominate any movie screen, but those Hollywood types are nothing but trouble. Do you know they&#x2019;ve completely closed a section of Abercorn Street?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been using a different route to come to work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Julian Street, too,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;There are dirt and straw all over the place, not to mention the disgusting road apples from the horses. My Lord, I&#x2019;ll be happy when they finish up their nonsense and go home, let things settle down to some semblance of normal around here.&#x201d;</p><p>But, as usual, her ire didn&#x2019;t last long. Spinning around, she beamed at the family of four who had been not-so-patiently waiting. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all are in for such a treat. Katie here is the best baker in town.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell over the door rang again, and my heart sank. Just as we were getting caught up. Then I saw who it was, and relief whooshed through me.</p><p>Mrs. Standish exclaimed, &#x201c;Mimsey Carmichael, as I live and breathe.&#x201d; Winking at me, she said in a loud whisper, &#x201c;Reinforcements at last.&#x201d; Three long strides later she was at the door, stooping to kiss our friend on the cheek before sailing into the late-spring morning with her whoopie pies.</p><p>At seventy-nine, Mimsey was the eldest member of the spellbook club, though she looked more than a decade younger. When Lucy first told me our unofficial leader didn&#x2019;t use magic to maintain her youthful appearance, I didn&#x2019;t know whether to believe her. However, over time I&#x2019;d come to agree with my aunt&#x2019;s assertion that it was her heartfelt affection for people and a vivid enthusiasm for life that gave Mimsey such vigor. I also admired her continued involvement in the day-to-day business of Vase Value, the flower shop she&#x2019;d owned for decades. She was a cream puff of a woman, shorter even than Aunt Lucy, though considerably more padded. Her smooth white pageboy sported a bow that mirrored the sherbet orange of her pantsuit, and her blue eyes crinkled at the corners when she saw me.</p><p>A man had followed her into the Honeybee, and she reached over to give his arm a quick pat. He directed a distracted smile down at her. Not much taller than my five-nine, he nonetheless towered over Mimsey. His short sandy hair was lightly threaded with gray, though from my vantage point his face appeared unlined.</p><p>I hurried to help the family who had finally reached the register. Even the girls seemed happy enough once they had an assortment of cookies in hand and settled at a table by the window.</p><p>Mimsey&#x2019;s intelligent gaze raked the room, taking in the situation. &#x201c;Have a seat, Simon,&#x201d; she cheerfully instructed her companion and bustled into the kitchen. Before I knew it, she was restocking the glass display case with blazing efficiency.</p><p>Simon, as she&#x2019;d called him, slid onto a recently vacated seat near the door. I could sense his skepticism from across the room.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t actually see auras, but after more than a year of practicing magic, I could sometimes sense the energy around other people as what I could describe only as flavors. It helped to have physical contact, and even then it didn&#x2019;t happen all that often. But once in a while I could tell if a person was inherently sweet or salty or, in some unfortunate cases, bitter. Something about the newcomer, backlit by the window behind him, made me want to know more about him. As soon as I&#x2019;d counted out change to the last customer in line and found myself with a little space to breathe, I centered myself and threw him a big welcoming smile.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t appear to notice, though. His head was bent over his phone, his thumbs tapping wildly on the screen. When it rang in his hand, he answered as if he&#x2019;d been expecting a call, gazing out the window at Broughton Street and talking rapidly. A couple at a nearby table shot him irritated looks. Perhaps his intensity felt out of place in their otherwise leisurely morning.</p><p>I felt Mimsey behind me and looked around to find her gesturing Lucy over to join us. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Simon Knapp,&#x201d; she said sotto voce.</p><p>&#x201c;And who, pray tell, is Simon Knapp?&#x201d; I matched her secretive tone.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think his title is production coordinator? He&#x2019;s the one who takes care of the actors&#x2014;and the director and crew on the movie set.&#x201d;</p><p>Simon&#x2019;s ears must have been burning because he stood and strode toward us, slipping his cell phone into the pocket of his tan chinos. His muscular arms were tan against the light blue of his silky T-shirt.</p><p><i>Nice.</i></p><p>Mimsey went on. &#x201c;If they need a certain prop or one of the actresses insists on having a bouquet of a particular flower delivered to her trailer, Simon is the one who tracks it down.&#x201d; She smiled broadly as he stopped in front of the register. &#x201c;In fact, that&#x2019;s how we became acquainted. He was looking for passionflowers for Althea Cole, and I just happened to have a fresh shipment at the shop.&#x201d; Mischief twinkled in her eyes.</p><p>Gentle amusement flashed across Lucy&#x2019;s face, and I refrained from comment. Mimsey was the best of us at divination, and &#x201c;just happening&#x201d; to have a fresh shipment of a relatively unusual flower was likely a result of her skill. Her pink, quartz-crystal shew stone often produced somewhat murky results&#x2014;except when it came to her attraction to color and flower magic.</p><p>Mimsey added, &#x201c;And Bianca agreed to provide the libations for Ms. Cole&#x2019;s nightly wine and cheese parties from Moon Grapes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And thank God she did.&#x201d; Simon&#x2019;s words came out fast and clipped. &#x201c;Because if Althea&#x2019;s unhappy, <i>everybody&#x2019;s</i> unhappy.&#x201d; He held out his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Simon Knapp.&#x201d;</p><p>Quickly, I brushed my hands on my yellow polka-dotted apron and shook it.

Beloved nun and social activist Joan Chittister, who appeared on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday, offers a practical, character-building, and inspirational guide to help you take control of your emotional life and redirect your spiritual destiny.<br><br>Joan Chittister, whom Publishers Weekly calls "one of the most well-known and trusted contemporary spiritual authors," is a rabble-rousing force of nature for social justice, and a passionate proponent of personal faith and spiritual fulfillment. Drawing on little known, ancient teachings of the saints, Sister Joan offers a practical program to help transform our thinking and rebel against our fears, judgments and insecurities.<br><br>"Freedom from anxiety, worry, and tensions at home and work, comes when we give ourselves to something greater," she argues. "We need to seek wisdom rather than simply facts, to think before speaking, and in turn create respectful communities." With a series of twelve simple rules for healthy spiritual living, Chittister not only reminds us, but pleads with us, to develop enduring values by shifting our attention to how God wants us to live. This book will teach you how to accomplish this.</p><p>Joan Chittister, O.S.B., is an internationally known writer and lecturer and the executive director of Benetvision, a resource and research center for contemporary spirituality in Erie, Pennsylvania. A Benedictine Sister of Erie, Pennsylvania, she served as president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, president of the Conference of American Benedictine Prioresses, and was prioress of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie for twelve years. Sister Joan received her doctorate from Penn State University in speech communications theory. She has received numerous awards for her work on behalf of peace and women in church and in society.<p>The First Step of Humility</p><p>Recognize That God Is God</p><p>The first step of humility, then, is that we keep &#x201c;the fear--the reverence--of God always before our eyes (Ps. 36:2) and never forget it.&#x201d;</p><p>What is the challenge here?</p><p>Humility has never been easy for me, at least not in the way it&#x2019;s written about in Chapter 7 of the Rule of Benedict.</p><p>I remember it all too well: It was 1952. I was a novice then, and preparation for full membership in the community was intense. Study, prayer, and almost total withdrawal from society marked that year as special, as different.</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t take college classes. Instead, we studied only the sixth-century Rule of Benedict, which formed the framework in which we would live out the rest of our lives. We not only prayed seven times a day but we studied the Latin in which the prayers were written in order to make those prayer periods understandable. Most of all, we concentrated on the Rule itself and, particularly, its cornerstone chapter, &#x201c;Of Humility.&#x201d;</p><p>Every morning, in fact, we took an hour out of the day&#x2019;s regular duties--like baking altar breads or cleaning the chapel, washing windows or working in the kitchen--to study the Rule of Life under which we would soon promise to live. And that reading alone, not the manual labor, could well have been enough to make any thought of taking another step in the process impossible.</p><p>First, the Rule itself had been written fifteen centuries before this novitiate. Second, the book needed a good editor. Its language was for the most part musty and terse. And at least to a teenager in 1952, in a postwar era that had new and liberating written all over it, the ideas were chilling. One, in particular, drew my attention--and troubled me deeply: We were to &#x201c;keep the fear of God always before our eyes and never forget it.&#x201d; Life was to be about &#x201c;the fear of God&#x201d;? Oh, great.</p><p>Years later, of course, they told us that &#x201c;the fear of God&#x201d; was now an archaic term, which meant &#x201c;a mixed feeling of dread and reverence,&#x201d; but no one stressed the &#x201c;reverence&#x201d; of it in those days. &#x201c;The fear of God&#x201d; was the current translation, the defining essence of the relationship, and it stuck.</p><p>But I was young and new to monastic life, and the very language of this first step of humility was itself enough to be discouraging. What did it mean to &#x201c;keep the fear of God always before our eyes&#x201d;? I found the words stifling. Threatening, if truth were told. This God, it seemed, forever hovered over us just waiting for us to slip up. Then all heaven would pounce and, as the old Church manuals made so clear, close the gates of life to us forever. How could we possibly reverence a God like that, a God waiting in the dark, a specter in the night?</p><p>We were, I figured, entrapped by the presence of God, not liberated by it at all: This God sees &#x201c;the thoughts of my heart,&#x201d; the chapter on humility put it. A discouraging thought in itself. We were condemned in that case just for thinking about something, before we even got a chance to try it. And yet, over the years, another light began to dawn: If that was true, then something else was surely just as true. This God who knew everything had to know, too, how hard I was trying to live decently, to love deeply, to grow beyond the gaps in my soul. And that, at least, was a calming thought.</p><p>But, there was something else that still bothered me: How was it even possible to claim to have nothing but God on my mind? How realistic could any of this be? My spirit sank. Did any of this chapter make sense? And if it did, would I ever be able to do it? I knew down deep that if the way this chapter read were really the way things were meant to be, I doubted that I would ever manage to get it right.</p><p>I simply could not imagine how to be perfectly immersed in God. Perfectly attuned to God. Perfectly satisfied with a life more intent on perfection than on life itself. I was looking for a spiritual life that was more grounded, more real, less ethereal. I wanted to move on, to find more of the sacred in life rather than cut it off in the name of Life. Something in me insisted that I needed to become fully human before I could even think of being perfectly holy. Why? Because striving to come to fullness is the nature of the human condition, and without that how can anyone be truly holy?</p><p>When I was younger, I didn&#x2019;t question that perfection was possible. The truth, I learned as life went on, is that there is, indeed, always something lacking in us. We are not born perfect. The very process of human development--slow, stumbling, inquisitive, fickle all the way from infancy to old age--is proof of that. And I was living proof of that. I certainly did not become perfect as the years went by, however clear religion class had been about the process. I&#x2019;m not even sure I wanted to be perfect if being afraid to try, to taste, to fail, and only then to try again was what it was all about. On the contrary, I seemed only to get further and further away from a spiritual ideal that felt to me like a living death. Every day, every new failure, left me less and less convinced that the ideal was even possible.</p><p>One situation in particular riled me every single day.</p><p>The prayer schedule provided for exercises in examination of conscience once at noon and again at night. Each of them concentrated on what we had done wrong that day. No one ever suggested that we might thank God for having helped us do anything right. So, I knelt in my pew, head down, and accused myself of things I considered too small, too meaningless, on which to waste my time. The Novice Directress, for instance, was particularly stressed by the fact that I walked too quickly, too loudly, on my leather soles in the hollow-sounding halls. Don&#x2019;t forget that one at examen time, I knew.</p><p>This &#x201c;life of perfection&#x201d; in a world of human imperfection was beginning to look like an excursion in neurosis. Surely the spiritual life was about more than walking heavily--a failing we were taught to confess weekly--along with dropping pins, spilling food, and making mistakes during community prayer. The boundaries between the moral, the immoral, and the amoral began to slip away, to blur, to become almost meaningless.</p><p>No, this great confrontation with God in the first step of humility had to be about more than making petty mistakes as we went about the routines of life. Clearly, the spiritual life had been reduced to a kind of psychosocial obsession someplace along the line. It was all about what we did and how. But what was that doing to the level of spirituality we were developing as a result? How could this possibly be the stuff of which sanctity was made?</p><p>If truth were known, every day of that regime I failed in more and more ways. Everything called &#x201c;good&#x201d; here was foreign to me. I spoke out of turn, ruminated incessantly, and broke silence repeatedly--which I learned quickly was a more reprehensible matter than the fact that what I was saying might be considered virtuous. So I said one thing in public and thought other things in private. I stayed on the path to religious life but spent a lot of time thinking about all the other paths I could have, and maybe should have, taken. I got smaller and smaller in my thinking, and my world got narrower as well. I felt like I was constantly underwater, my lungs bursting for want of breath, my heart stopped in midair. Most difficult of all, I was beginning to accept the fact that the &#x201c;spiritual life&#x201d; was a thing for spiritual children who counted childish things as its common currency.</p><p>&#x201c;Love not your own will,&#x201d; the chapter on humility stressed. And I tried to stretch to those heights. But love what instead, then, I thought, in this place of puny pieties? &#x201c;Our actions everywhere are in God&#x2019;s sight,&#x201d; the Rule reminded me, &#x201c;and are reported by angels at every hour,&#x201d; looking for sins and vices. The more I read, the more I felt trapped in the centrifuge of the self. I became a constant subject of my own smallness. Or, as a friend of mine told me years later, &#x201c;I left the Church because if I stayed there I never could be anything but a failure.&#x201d;</p><p>What kind of spirituality was this? And what kind of God were we dealing with?</p><p>Where was the greatness of the spiritual life? Surely I had seen it once. In fact, I had tracked it in the wake of figures before us who had blazed an arc across the sky of life for all of us to follow.</p><p>Where, for instance, was the grand-heartedness of a Teresa of Avila, who had turned religious life upside down in her era--and sent my vision of it soaring in my own? Or a Martin of Tours, who refused to fight in the Roman imperial army in order to follow the peacemaker Jesus? Or a Joan of Arc, who argued conscience against the Church itself and had been willing to die for it? Or a Mother Catherine McAuley, who laid her life down to educate illiterate girls? Or a Mary Ward, who was condemned for trying to renew religious life outside of the spiritual architecture of her time but prevailed in the long run regardless? Or a Dorothy Day, who spent her life trying to recall the Church itself to the Gospel? These, and hundreds of others like them, had set my young soul on fire before I entered the monastery. But now here I was. This spiritual tradition, they told me, had lasted for over fifteen hundred years, yes. But was there anything left to it beyond the palest shadow of a guide to a kind of holiness crafted and gone dry in ages before? There had to be more to it than this equation of humility and spirituality with humiliation and repression. I simply could not see in this chapter on humility a God great enough to follow.</p><p>Little by little I began to realize that it was not the spirituality of humility of which this chapter purports to speak that creates a problem. It was the notion of the kind of God to whom we owe homage that created the barriers. It was not the spirituality of humility that was my undoing. It was the image of God I had brought with me to the chapter that was my undoing.</p><p>But as the years went by, slowly but surely, the greater vision came back into focus. I finally uncovered the references to the psalms that this chapter on humility cited as its luminarias along the way to the expansion of the soul. The concern of the psalmists to whom Benedict&#x2019;s Rule points in this chapter is a God much bigger than the one forged by the popular notion of perfection. It is that God who eventually became the beacon and the rudder of life for me.</p><p>What is the underlying issue?</p><p>If fear of God is the kernel and core of Benedictine humility, then the questions that must underlie our understanding it are these: Who is this God to whom we owe &#x201c;fear, reverence, awe, genuflection&#x201d;? How did Benedict of Nursia himself understand God? And, most of all, what does that say about the spiritual life in the Benedictine tradition, let alone to our own singular and often dispiriting journeys to God? And how shall we know if our concept of God and Benedict&#x2019;s concept of God are in sync?</p><p>One way to study the mind of Benedict--seldom marked, too often overlooked by modern readers of this ancient Rule--is to follow closely the Scripture passages Benedict draws on to give us a picture of God. Then there can be no misunderstanding about who it is to whom we owe both awe and homage. In fact, in this chapter Benedict chronicles God in action for us. He allows Scripture itself to explain this first step of humility by carefully citing the verses of the psalms that confirm his vision of God and the holy life.</p><p>Benedict&#x2019;s God is a defense from the storms of life, not a threat to human thriving (Ps. 7:10). This God sees everything, yes, which means that this God sees more than our weaknesses. This God sees, too, our needs, our pain, the struggle of being human (Ps. 38:10) and rewards those whose hearts are right and whose souls are righteous (Ps. 18:24). It is to this loving God, this merciful God, that we are to bring thankfulness, praise, veneration, awe--and genuflection (Ps. 50:21).</p><p>Clearly, to Benedict, God is a mighty God. This God knows what we are and stands with arms open to receive us--always and regardless. This is a poignant vision of God, a comforting one. This is a God who wants love, not fear, to be the bond between us. And real love, every lover knows, never goes away. Instead, it creates a kind of invisible but crystalline scrim toward which we are forever reaching out, however great the distance, to grasp the all of it.</p><p>Benedict is very clear about the character of God. This is a not a God of wrath, not a God who is indifferent to the world, not a ghoul of a God who spies on us in hope of watching us fall from grace. Most of all, this is not a &#x201c;gotcha God&#x201d; who simply lies in wait to punish us when we do. On the contrary.</p><p>In this light, God, the Doer of Magical Miracles outside the natural order, disappears. Instead, the God of Creation frees nature to take its course with us as we, too, test and taste and grow in wisdom, age, and grace. Having experienced life in all its glory, all its grief, we grow to the full height of our humanity. It is a slow process, yes, but in the end our choice for God is valid, is holy, because it is real, considered, not forced, not extorted. This God wants for creation the fullness of all the good that is in it.</p><p>Most of all, this caring God loves us and so refuses to interfere with our judgments or prevent our experiments with life. Instead, this God does us the respect of simply standing by, of being there to hold us up, of confirming our trust by leading us through the dim days and long nights. How else to explain the depth of soul of those who have survived great calamity, endured the brutal death of a child, struggled through crippling debilitation, torturous addictions, and yet come out of all of it praising the God who carried them through? Once we have known the strengthening presence of God in our own lives, we feel even closer to the God of Life after the tragedy than we did before it. No doubt about it: This God trusts humanity to work its own way to the fullness of its soulfulness.</p></p><h2>Story of O</h2><p>O is a young, beautiful fashion photographer in Paris. One day her lover, Rene, takes her to a chateau, where she is enslaved, with Rene&#39;s approval, and systematically sexually assaulted by various other men. Later, Rene turns O over to Sir Stephen, an English friend who intensifies the brutality. But the final humiliation is yet to come.</p><p>Pauline R�age (1907-1998) is a pseudonym of Anne Desclos, a French journalist and novelist.<br><br>Kthe Mazur, an AudioFile Earphones Award winner, has worked extensively as an actress in film, theater, and television. She has recorded over one hundred audiobooks.I<br><br>The Lovers of Roissy<br><br>Her lover one day takes O for a walk in a section of the city where they never go--the Montsouris Park, the Monceau Park. After they have taken a stroll in the park and have sat together side by side on the edge of a lawn, they notice, at one corner of the park, at an intersection where there are never any taxis, a car which, because of its meter, resembles a taxi.<br><br>"Get in," he says.<br><br>She gets in. It is autumn, and coming up to dusk. She is dressed as she always is: high heels, a suit with a pleated skirt, a silk blouse, and no hat. But long gloves which come up over the sleeves of her jacket, and in her leather handbag she has her identification papers, her compact, and her lipstick.<br><br>The taxi moves off slowly, the man still not having said a word to the driver. But he pulls down the shades of the windows on both sides of the car, and the shade on the back window. She has taken off her gloves, thinking he wants to kiss her or that he wants her to caress him. But instead he says:<br><br>"Your bag's in your way; let me have it."<br><br>She gives it to him. He puts it out of her reach and adds:<br><br>"You also have on too many clothes. Unfasten your stockings and roll them down to above your knees. Here are some garters."<br><br>By now the taxi has picked up speed, and she has some trouble managing it; she's also afraid the driver may turn around. Finally, though, the stockings are rolled down, and she's embarrassed to feel her legs naked and free beneath her silk slip. Besides, the loose garter-belt suspenders are slipping back and forth.<br><br>"Unfasten your garter belt," he says, "and take off your panties."<br><br>That's easy enough, all she has to do is slip her hands behind her back and raise herself slightly. He takes the garter belt and panties from her, opens her bag and puts them in, then says:<br><br>"You shouldn't sit on your slip and skirt. Pull them up behind you and sit directly on the seat."<br><br>The seat is made of some sort of imitation leather which is slippery and cold: it's quite an extraordinary sensation to feel it sticking to your thighs. Then he says:<br><br>"Now put your gloves back on."<br><br>The taxi is still moving along at a good clip, and she doesn't dare ask why Rene just sits there without moving or saying another word, nor can she guess what all this means to him--having her there motionless, silent, so stripped and exposed, so thoroughly gloved, in a black car going God knows where. He hasn't told her what to do or what not to do, but she's afraid either to cross her legs or press them together. She sits with gloved hands braced on either side of her seat.<br><br>"Here we are," he says suddenly. Here we are: the taxi stops on a lovely avenue, beneath a tree--they are plane trees--in front of some sort of small private home which can be seen nestled between the courtyard and the garden, the type of small private dwelling one finds along the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The street lamps are some distance away, and it is still fairly dark inside the car. Outside it is raining.<br><br>"Don't move," Rene says. "Sit perfectly still."<br><br>His hand reaches for the collar of her blouse, unties the bow, then unbuttons the blouse. She leans forward slightly, thinking he wants to fondle her breasts. No. He is merely groping for the shoulder straps of her brassiere, which he snips with a small penknife. Then he takes it off. Now, beneath her blouse, which he has buttoned back up, her breasts are naked and free, as is the rest of her body, from waist to knee.<br><br>"Listen," he says. "Now you're ready. This is where I leave you. You're to get out and go ring the doorbell. Follow whoever opens the door for you, and do whatever you're told. If you hesitate about going in, they'll come and take you in. If you don't obey immediately, they'll force you to. Your bag? No, you have no further need for your bag. You're merely the girl I'm furnishing. Yes, of course I'll be there. Now run along."<br><br>Another version of the same beginning was simpler and more direct: the young woman, dressed in the same way, was driven by her lover and an unknown friend. The stranger was driving, the lover was seated next to the young woman, and it was the unknown friend who explained to the young woman that her lover had been entrusted with the task of getting her ready, that he was going to tie her hands behind her back, unfasten her stockings and roll them down, remove her garter belt, her panties, and her brassiere, and blindfold her. That she would then be turned over to the chateau, where in due course she would be instructed as to what she should do. And, in fact, as soon as she had been thus undressed and bound, they helped her to alight from the car after a trip that lasted half an hour, guided her up a few steps and, with her blindfold still on, through one or two doors. Then, when her blindfold was removed, she found herself standing alone in a dark room, where they left her for half an hour, or an hour, or two hours, I can't be sure, but it seemed forever. Then, when at last the door was opened and the light turned on, you could see that she had been waiting in a very conventional, comfortable, yet distinctive room: there was a thick rug on the floor, but not a stick of furniture, and all four walls were lined with closets. The door had been opened by two women, two young and beautiful women dressed in the garb of pretty eighteenth-century chamber-maids: full skirts made out of some light material, which were long enough to conceal their feet; tight bodices, laced or hooked in front, which sharply accentuated the bust line; lace frills around the neck; half-length sleeves. They were wearing eye shadow and lipstick. Both wore a close-fitting collar and had tight bracelets on their wrists.<br><br>I know it was at this point that they freed O's hands, which were still tied behind her back, and told her to get undressed, they were going to bathe her and make her up. They proceeded to strip her till she hadn't a stitch of clothing left, then put her clothes away neatly in one of the closets. She was not allowed to bathe herself, and they did her hair as at the hairdresser's, making her sit in one of those large chairs which tilts back when they wash your hair and straightens back up after the hair has been set and you're ready for the dryer. That always takes at least an hour. Actually it took more than an hour, but she was seated on this chair, naked, and they kept her from either crossing her legs or bringing them together. And since the wall in front of her was covered from floor to ceiling with a large mirror, which was unbroken by any shelving, she could see herself, thus open, each time her gaze strayed to the mirror.<br><br>When she was properly made up and prepared--her eyelids penciled lightly; her lips bright red; the tip and halo of her breasts highlighted with pink; the edges of her nether lips rouged; her armpits and pubis generously perfumed, and perfume also applied to the furrow between her thighs, the furrow beneath her breasts, and to the hollows of her hands--she was led into a room where a three-sided mirror, and another mirror behind, enabled her to examine herself closely. She was told to sit down on the ottoman, which was set between the mirrors, and wait. The ottoman was covered with black fur, which pricked her slightly; the rug was black, the walls red. She was wearing red mules. Set in one of the walls of the small bedroom was a large window, which looked out onto a lovely, dark park. The rain had stopped, the trees were swaying in the wind, the moon raced high among the clouds.<br><br>I have no idea how long she remained in the red bedroom, or whether she was really alone, as she surmised, or whether someone was watching her through a peephole camouflaged in the wall. All I know is that when the two women returned, one was carrying a dressmaker's tape measure and the other a basket. With them came a man dressed in a long purple robe, the sleeves of which were gathered at the wrists and full at the shoulders. When he walked the robe flared open, from the waist down. One could see that beneath his robe he had on some sort of tights which covered his legs and thighs but left the sex exposed. It was the sex that O saw first, when he took his first step, then the whip, made of leather thongs, which he had stuck in his belt. Then she saw that the man was masked by a black hood--which concealed even his eyes behind a network of black gauze--and, finally, that he was also wearing fine black kid gloves.<br><br>Using the familiar tu form of address, he told her not to move and ordered the women to hurry. The woman with the tape then took the measurements of O's neck and wrists. Though on the small side, her measurements were in no way out of the ordinary, and it was easy enough to find the right-sized collar and bracelets, in the basket the other woman was carrying. Both collar and bracelets were made of several layers of leather (each layer being fairly thin, so that the total was no more than the thickness of a finger). They had clasps, which functioned automatically like a padlock when it closes, and they could be opened only by means of a small key. Imbedded in the layers of leather, directly opposite the lock, was a snugly-fitting metal ring, which allowed one to get a grip on the bracelet, if one wanted to attach it, for both collar and bracelets fit the arms and neck so smugly--although not so tight as to be the least painful--that it was impossible to slip any bond inside.<br><br>So they fastened the collar and bracelets to her neck and wrists, and the man told her to get up. He took her place on the fur ottoman, called her over till she was touching his knees, slipped his gloved hand between her thighs and over her breasts, and explained to her that she would be presented that same evening, after she had dined alone.<br><br>She did in fact dine by herself, still naked, in a sort of little cabin where an invisible hand passed the dishes to her through a small window in the door. Finally, when dinner was over, the two women came for her. In the bedroom, they fastened the two bracelet rings together behind her back. They attached a long red cape to the ring of her collar and draped it over her shoulders. It covered her completely, but opened when she walked, since, with her hands behind her back, she had no way of keeping it closed. One woman preceded her, opening the doors, and the other followed, closing them behind her. They crossed a vestibule, two drawing rooms, and went into the library, where four men were having coffee. They were wearing the same long robes as the first, but no masks. And yet O did not have time to see their faces or ascertain whether her lover was among them (he was), for one of the men shone a light in her eyes and blinded her. Everyone remained stock still, the two women flanking her and the men in front, studying her. Then the light went out; the women left. But O was blindfolded again. Then they made her walk forward--she stumbled slightly as she went--until she felt that she was standing in front of the fire around which the four men were seated: she could feel the heat, and in the silence she could hear the quiet crackling of the burning logs. She was facing the fire. Two hands lifted her cape, two others--after having checked to see that her bracelets were attached--descended the length of her back and buttocks. The hands were not gloved, and one of them penetrated her in both places at once, so abruptly that she cried out. Someone laughed. Someone else said:<br><br>"Turn her around, so we can see the breasts and the belly."<br><br>They turned her around, and the heat of the fire was against her back. A hand seized one of her breasts, a mouth fastened on the tip of the other. But suddenly she lost her balance and fell backward (supported by whose arms?), while they opened her legs and gently spread her lips. Hair grazed the insides of her thighs. She heard them saying that they would have to make her kneel down. This they did. She was extremely uncomfortable in this position, especially because they forbade her to bring her knees together and because her arms pinioned behind her forced her to lean forward. Then they let her rock back a bit, so that she was half-sitting on her heels, as nuns are wont to do.<br><br>"You've never tied her up?"<br><br>"No, never."<br><br>"And never whipped her?"<br><br>"No, never whipped her either. But as a matter of fact . . ."<br><br>It was her lover speaking.<br><br>"As a matter of fact," the other voice went on, "if you do tie her up from time to time, or whip her just a little, and she begins to like it, that's no good either. You have to get past the pleasure stage, until you reach the stage of tears."<br><br>Then they made O get up and were on the verge of untying her, probably in order to attach her to some pole or wall, when someone protested that he wanted to take her first, right there on the spot. So they made her kneel down again, this time with her bust on an ottoman, her hands still tied behind her, with her hips higher than her torso. Then one of the men, holding her with both his hands on her hips, plunged into her belly. He yielded to a second. The third wanted to force his way into the narrower passage and, driving hard, made her scream. When he let her go, sobbing and befouled by tears beneath her blindfold, she slipped to the floor, only to feel someone's knees against her face, and she realized that her mouth was not to be spared. Finally, they let her go, a captive clothed in tawdry finery, lying on her back in front of the fire. She could hear glasses being filled and the sound of the men drinking, and the scraping of chairs. They put some more wood on the fire. All of a sudden they removed her blindfold. The large room, the walls of which were lined with bookcases, was dimly lit by a single wall lamp and by the light of the fire, which was beginning to burn more brightly. Two of the men were standing and smoking. Another was seated, a riding crop on his knees, and the one leaning over her fondling her breast was her lover. All four of them had taken her, and she had not been able to distinguish him from the others.</p><h2>Savage Gods</h2><p><p><strong><em>* Chicago Tribune</em> "Fall literary preview: books you need to read now"<br><em>* Vulture&nbsp;</em>"The Best and Biggest Books to Read This Fall"</strong></p><p>NORTH AMERICAN EDITION: After moving with his wife and two children to a smallholding in Ireland, Paul Kingsnorth expects to find contentment.

He began writing poetry as a schoolboy. He worked as a policeman in Spanish Town and when he was twenty-two had his first volume of poems, Songs of Jamaica (1912) published. In 1912 McKay moved to the United States where he attended Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and Kansas State University. He continued to write poetry and in 1918 his work was praised by both Frank Harris and Max Eastman. The following year, his poem, If We Must Die, was published in Eastman&#39;s journal, The Liberator. Frank Harris encouraged McKay to obtain writing experience in England. In 1919 McKay travelled to England where he met George Bernard Shaw who introduced him to influential left-wing figures in journalism. This included Sylvia Pankhurst, who recruited him to write for her trade union journal, Workers&#39; Dreadnought. While in London McKay read the works of Karl Marx and becomes a committed socialist. In 1921 McKay returned to New York and became associate editor of The Liberator. Over the next year the journal published articles by McKay such as How Black Sees Green and Red and He Who Gets Slapped. He also published his best known volume of verse, Harlem Shadows (1922). In 1922 McKay went to Third International in Moscow where he represented the American Workers Party. He stayed in Europe where he wrote Trial by Lynching: Stories About Negro Life in America (1925) and Home to Harlem (1928), a novel about a disillusioned black soldier in the US Army who returns from the Western Front to live in a black ghetto. This was followed by other novels such as Banjo (1928), Gingertown (1932) and Banana Bottom (1933). McKay gradually lost faith in communism and returned to the United States in 1934. Employment was difficult to find and for a while he worked for the Federal Writers&#39; Project. McKay&#39;s published work during this period included his autobiography, A Long Way From Home (1937) and Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). Unable to make a living from writing, McKay found work in a shipbuilding yard. In 1943 he suffers a stroke and the following year was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. In 1945 his essay, On Becoming a Roman Catholic, was published.

Freshly graduated from Radcliffe College after growing up in a distinguished and privileged New York City family, the last thing she expected was to fall in love and marry a Sicilian. <i>On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal</i> is the ambivalent love story of an intelligent, complex, and self-reflective woman. The book recounts the events of 1983, the year Simeti turned 42. Her narrative alternates between Palermo, where her children attend school and her husband Toninno is a professor of agricultural economy, and Bosco, in eastern Sicily, where she shoulders demanding responsibilities on the working farm that has belonged to her husband's family for three generations. <p> Simeti feels the isolation of being an expatriate and outsider, although she claims to welcome this perspective when faced with frustration and disgust at the pervading political corruption and corrosive effects of the Mafia on everyday life. Despite her natural diffidence, she shares personal insights that make<i>On Persephone's Island</i> as compelling as her prose. Simeti intersperses rich helpings of Sicilian history and culture with mundane events and insight into what motivates the peasants essential to the survival of the family farm. And she makes pessimistic observations about the complexity of changing times in a society where the persistent reliance on feudal relationships and agriculture is finally crumbling. </p><p> An academic manqu�, Simeti researches and ruminates on the mythological underpinnings of the many holidays and festivals that punctuate the rhythm of Sicilian life. She focuses particularly on the Greek goddesses Persephone and Demeter, who held Sicily under their protection. She eventually discovers a correlation between her own situation and the story of Persephone, who alternately inhabited the worlds of light and darkness.</p><b>Mary Taylor Simeti</b> is an American expert in Sicilian medieval and culinary history.

She hadn&#x2019;t expected to hear about a death. &#x201c;Is Charles the son? The one who was a few years older than I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sadly, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh dear. I thought maybe you meant his father.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, his father is Gerald.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did he die? Was it an accident?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he was taken ill and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her mother shrugged. Sometimes people just died, and no one knew why. As a nurse, Sarah understood that even better than most.</p><p>&#x201c;Was he married?&#x201d; Sarah had lost touch with most of her old friends when she&#x2019;d eloped with her first husband, a lowly physician, and turned her back on her family&#x2019;s wealth and social position.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, just over a year, I believe. No children, though, which is sad because he was an only child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always sad when a young person dies.&#x201d; Neither of them spoke of Sarah&#x2019;s sister, who had died young, but Sarah could almost feel Maggie&#x2019;s presence in the room.</p><p>Her mother toyed with her empty coffee cup for a moment, carefully not meeting Sarah&#x2019;s eye.</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, what is it?&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;I have to pay a condolence call on the family. I was hoping you&#x2019;d go with me.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah actually winced. She&#x2019;d been afraid of this. Not of an old friend dying, but of being drawn back into her mother&#x2019;s world of high society with its strict and meaningless rules and obligations.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you haven&#x2019;t seen them in years,&#x201d; her mother hurried on before Sarah could protest. &#x201c;But you and Mr. Malloy are going to have to find your place in society now, and starting with your old friends seems like a natural way to begin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My <i>old friend</i> Charles is dead,&#x201d; Sarah reminded her.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I mean. I know you think my life is silly&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mother, I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother denying it. And you&#x2019;re right, a lot of the things I do aren&#x2019;t very important, but you and Mr. Malloy will need friends when you marry. Maybe you think your life isn&#x2019;t going to change very much just because you&#x2019;ll be wealthy, but you&#x2019;ll see, Sarah. People you know now won&#x2019;t want to associate with you anymore. They&#x2019;ll either be jealous or they&#x2019;ll assume you think yourselves too good for them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we won&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you won&#x2019;t, but they&#x2019;ll think it anyway. You&#x2019;ve seen it already. Mr. Malloy had to leave the police force, and his poor mother had to leave her old neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>Once the story of Malloy&#x2019;s sudden change of fortune had appeared in the newspapers, the Malloys had indeed been forced to leave the neighborhood where they&#x2019;d lived since Mrs. Malloy had come over from Ireland as a young girl. &#x201c;But that was just because the reporters wouldn&#x2019;t leave them alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And because all her old friends wouldn&#x2019;t even speak to her anymore unless they were asking for money. Sarah, when you&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She gestured vaguely.</p><p>&#x201c;Rich?&#x201d; Sarah supplied.</p><p>&#x201c;I was going to say a member of the privileged classes, but yes, <i>wealthy</i>. When you&#x2019;re wealthy, the only people who feel comfortable with you are people just like you. Believe me, you will feel the same.&#x201d;</p><p>As much as she hoped otherwise, Sarah was afraid her mother was right. &#x201c;So paying a condolence call on the Oakes family is to be my first step back into your world?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your world, too, or at least it was for most of your life. And yes, it could be. Charles&#x2019;s widow will need friends.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah knew when she was beaten. &#x201c;When did you want to go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This afternoon if you&#x2019;re free. I need to go home and change, and I can send the carriage back for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not necessary. I&#x2019;ll change here and go home with you. At least I have some appropriate clothes now.&#x201d; Sarah and her mother had started buying her trousseau. As a widowed midwife, her wardrobe had been much more practical and utilitarian than fashionable, so she&#x2019;d been slowly adding new items.</p><p>Less than a half hour later, Sarah had changed into a stylish suit of myrtle green batiste in deference to the early fall weather. Since Sarah&#x2019;s daughter, Catherine, and her nursemaid, Maeve, were off visiting the park, they were able to get away without too much fuss.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think you&#x2019;ll keep a carriage when you&#x2019;re married?&#x201d; her mother asked as her own carried them away from Sarah&#x2019;s Bank Street home.</p><p>&#x201c;Our house has a mews, although the previous owners hadn&#x2019;t used the stables for a long time. Keeping horses in the city is such a lot of bother, though. Now tell me about Charles&#x2019;s family. I remember there&#x2019;s something unusual about his mother, but I can&#x2019;t remember what.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s Southern.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. Where is she from again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now I remember. Charles was always ashamed of that, I think, or maybe just embarrassed. He was teased, I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course he was. After the war, people were angry and bitter. So many young men died or were maimed, and of course they blamed the South for starting it all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they did start it all by seceding from the Union.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mother smiled sadly. &#x201c;Gerald liked to remind them that <i>Jenny</i> didn&#x2019;t start it and that she was just as much a victim as they were. Even still, many people hated Jenny on principle, without ever bothering to meet her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But how on earth did she ever get to New York in the first place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gerald sent her. Oh, it was all very romantic, although it was also very tragic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great romances are often tragic,&#x201d; Sarah said. &#x201c;Like Romeo and Juliet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fortunately, Gerald and Jenny&#x2019;s ended much better than that one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So he must have met her when he was in the army.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to remember the whole story, but it&#x2019;s been a long time since I heard it. Jenny&#x2019;s family owned a plantation. I&#x2019;m sure of that, at least. Gerald was with General Sherman, and of course they were burning all the plantations as they marched to the sea, so it must have been Georgia. When they got to Jenny&#x2019;s home, she was the only one of her family left alive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How awful! She must have been just a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fifteen or sixteen, if I remember correctly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And she was there all alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a plantation, so they had slaves. Some of them had stayed, but when our troops burned the house, they had no place to go, so they followed the Union army. I understand that a lot of slaves did that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Jenny went with them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently. I don&#x2019;t remember the details. Probably, she had no choice, and at some point, Gerald noticed her. She really was a beautiful young woman. He was smitten, and he must have understood that such a beauty wouldn&#x2019;t remain innocent for long when surrounded by thousands of soldiers, so he claimed her for himself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my, this <i>is</i> a romantic story. So he sent her North?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After he married her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He married her? After just meeting her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He had to, because it was the only way to ensure that his family would accept her, and even then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, as you can imagine, they were none too pleased, but what could they do? Gerald&#x2019;s father had to travel down into the South to fetch her home. You can&#x2019;t believe how dangerous that was during the war. They may have hoped Gerald would come to his senses when the war ended and he finally got home, but she was already with child. So they pretended not to notice the social snubs, and eventually, people got used to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Charles was their only child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I expect Jenny will be devastated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you said he was married. His wife will be, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to drag you into this, Sarah, but I just couldn&#x2019;t bear to face it alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could have just turned down the corner of your card and had your maid carry it in for you.&#x201d; Such a gesture often replaced a visit when such a visit might be awkward or unpleasant.</p><p>Her mother&#x2019;s lovely face hardened for a moment. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t possibly do that. I know what it&#x2019;s like to lose a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mother, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Sarah said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right. But it&#x2019;s true. I always try to give comfort in situations like this. It&#x2019;s the least I can do, no matter how little I might enjoy it. Besides, Gerald and your father have been friends since childhood. And they both belong to the Knickerbocker Club, of course. So no matter what I think of Jenny&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, you don&#x2019;t like Jenny either?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but not because she&#x2019;s a Southerner. I don&#x2019;t like her because I don&#x2019;t like her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. That makes sense.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mother sighed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a difficult person to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she is, and is it any wonder? She lost her entire family and moved to a city she&#x2019;d never seen before with people she&#x2019;d never met who hated her on sight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Southerners are supposed to be charming. She didn&#x2019;t have to make it more difficult by being aloof.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe she was just shy. Or terrified. She was still a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was over thirty years ago. She&#x2019;s no longer a child, and she can&#x2019;t still be terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah wondered if that were true.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The Oakes family lived on Amsterdam Avenue, just a few blocks from Sarah&#x2019;s parents. The neighborhood was quietly prosperous. Understated town houses crowded the sidewalks with their marble steps before rising in stately elegance. These weren&#x2019;t the monstrous mansions of the Vanderbilts or the Astors on Fifth Avenue. These were homes in which families lived for generations with the dignity, modesty, and money inherited from their thrifty Dutch ancestors.</p><p>A black wreath on the front door told the world that the Oakes family was in mourning. The maid admitted them, and after a perfunctory inquiry to see if Mrs. Oakes was &#x201c;at home,&#x201d; Sarah and her mother followed the maid upstairs to the formal parlor.</p><p>Not everyone could wear black well, but Sarah decided that Jenny Oakes could probably wear anything well. She must be nearing fifty, but her skin was still flawless and her melted-chocolate eyes revealed no trace of her age. Her raven hair lay completely tamed against her well-shaped head, showing no betraying gray. Sarah would have guessed her to be at least ten years younger than she must be. If Mrs. Oakes plucked the gray hairs to maintain that fiction, who could blame her?</p><p>&#x201c;Jenny,&#x201d; her mother was saying. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so very sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Oakes rose from where she&#x2019;d been perched on the sofa in this perfectly appointed room. She wore a gown of unrelieved black, a black handkerchief clutched in one hand. She offered her cheek for Mrs. Decker&#x2019;s kiss and said, &#x201c;Thank you for coming, Elizabeth.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah heard just the slightest trace of the South in Mrs. Oakes&#x2019;s voice. Thirty years in the North had almost worn it away.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve brought Sarah with me,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;You remember her, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, although it&#x2019;s been a long time, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it has,&#x201d; Sarah acknowledged, giving Mrs. Oakes her hand. The woman was a bit taller than she and held herself like a queen, although Sarah noticed in passing that her dress wasn&#x2019;t new or anywhere close to it. Every society woman had a good, black dress in her wardrobe for mourning emergencies. Death struck with alarming frequency and often without warning, so one had to be prepared. Obviously, Mrs. Oakes hadn&#x2019;t needed her mourning dress in quite a while. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry to hear about Charles. I remember him well.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Oakes invited them to sit down and offered them tea.</p><p>When the maid had come with it and gone again, Sarah said, &#x201c;I understand Charles had been ill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really. He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he thought he&#x2019;d eaten something that didn&#x2019;t agree with him at first, especially when he was better the next day. By the time we realized how ill he really was and sent for the doctor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah watched the woman&#x2019;s face for any sign of grief and saw none. If she felt the pain of her only son&#x2019;s loss, she hid it well. Of course, her mother would remind her of the lessons of her youth when she was taught it was unseemly to show emotions.</p><p>Her mother was murmuring something sympathetic when the parlor doors opened. A young woman wearing a very new and stylish black gown stepped into the room. The widow, Sarah guessed, although she didn&#x2019;t look particularly grief stricken. She seemed pretty enough, although her petulant expression made it hard to really tell.</p><p>&#x201c;Elizabeth, you remember my daughter-in-law, Hannah, don&#x2019;t you? She was a Kingsley.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah had almost forgotten the habit the old families had of giving a person&#x2019;s pedigree.</p><p>Jenny introduced her guests. Hannah nodded stiffly at Elizabeth, then glanced at Sarah before silently dismissing her as someone of no importance. Then she made her way over and dutifully sat down on the sofa beside her mother-in-law. She was at least five years younger than Sarah, so their paths would never have crossed growing up. If she had been weeping for her dead husband, her eyes gave no indication of it.</p><p>Sarah&#x2019;s mother offered her condolences, but Hannah hadn&#x2019;t quite mastered her mother-in-law&#x2019;s restraint.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone should be sorry for me,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all so unfair.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenny gave her a sharp glance but Hannah never saw it.</p><p>&#x201c;We were invited to go to Newport this summer,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;but Charles said we couldn&#x2019;t go. Now we&#x2019;re in mourning, and I won&#x2019;t be able to go anyplace at all for a whole year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Charles didn&#x2019;t die just to inconvenience you, my dear,&#x201d; Jenny said with the barest trace of venom.</p><p>Sarah glanced at her mother, whose wide eyes betrayed her shock at such inappropriate behavior. She tried to smooth things over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure not going to Newport was a disappointment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It certainly was,&#x201d; Hannah said. &#x201c;And the worst part was that we couldn&#x2019;t go because Charles said he had to go to work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Charles had been appointed superintendent of the Manhattan State Hospital,&#x201d; Jenny said, giving Hannah another glare, although Hannah didn&#x2019;t appear to notice.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I saw it mentioned in the newspapers,&#x201d; Sarah&#x2019;s mother said. &#x201c;It was a very nice write-up about him and the hospital, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They call it a hospital,&#x201d; Hannah said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s really an asylum. A place for crazy people. Can you imagine? What would Charles know about crazy people?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was an administrative position,&#x201d; Jenny said, more to Sarah and her mother than to Hannah. &#x201c;His job was to manage the institution, not deal with the patients.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Hannah said. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know why we couldn&#x2019;t go to Newport. The season there is only two months. That&#x2019;s not very long to be away.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah&#x2019;s mother had had enough of Hannah. She turned back to Jenny. &#x201c;I remember hearing about Charles&#x2019;s appointment. You must have been very proud.&#x201d;</p><p>Some emotion Sarah couldn&#x2019;t identify flickered over Jenny&#x2019;s face, causing a tightness around her mouth. &#x201c;Charles has many friends in the city.&#x201d;</p><p>Or maybe she wasn&#x2019;t so proud.</p><p>Sarah&#x2019;s mother quickly began inquiring about funeral arrangements, which seemed cheerful by comparison to Hannah&#x2019;s inappropriate bitterness over her husb...</p></p><h2>The Big Balloon Race, Level 3 (I Can Read)</h2><p>Ariel would love to be in the basket of <em> Lucky Star</em> on the day of the big balloon race against Bernard the Brave.

Leckie is a skilled military historian, mixing battle strategy and analysis with portraits of the men who fought on both sides to give the reader a complete account of the invasion. Lasting 83 days and surpassing D-Day in both troops and material used, the Battle of Okinawa was a decisive victory for the Allies, and a huge blow to Japan. In this stirring and readable account, Leckie provides a complete picture of the battle and its context in the larger war.</p><p> </p></p><p><b>Robert Leckie</b>&nbsp;(1920&#x2013;2001) was the author of more than 30 works of military history as well as&nbsp;<i>Marines!</i>, a collection of short stories, and&nbsp;<i>Lord, What a Family!</i>, a memoir.<i>&nbsp;</i>Raised in Rutherford, New Jersey, he started writing professionally at age 16,<i>&nbsp;</i>covering sports for&nbsp;the<i> Bergen Evening Record</i><b>&nbsp;</b>of Hackensack, New Jersey. Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, going on to serve as a machine gunner<i>&nbsp;</i>and as an intelligence scout and participating in all 1st Marine Division campaigns except<i>&nbsp;</i>Okinawa.&nbsp;He was awarded five battle stars, the Naval Commendation<i>&nbsp;</i>Medal with Combat V, and the Purple Heart. <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i>&nbsp;was his first book; it received the USMC<i>&nbsp;</i>Combat Correspondents Association Award upon publication.On this 50th anniversary of the battle of Okinawa (April to June 1945), we can expect an avalanche of titles about this last major battle of World War II. Okinawa was an epic amphibious-air-sea-land battle the likes of which may never be seen again. The conflict raged for 83 days; 13,000 Americans and 100,000 Japanese perished. Kamikazes sank 34 and damaged 361 U.S. vessels. Both Astor and Leckie are experienced military historians who tell their stories in the words of participants. Astor interviewed numerous veterans and compiled a masterful account of the battle as seen through the eyes of both American and Japanese survivors. He explores the history, training, and morale of the army and marine divisions and demonstrates why each was bound to succeed or fail.

There are four chapters in this book, each covering different accomplishments of his life. It is stated that, although discovered more than 300 years ago, Isaac Newton s laws of motion still help scientists calculate orbits and send spacecraft to other planets. It is amazing how his interest began with the mill he built. He wondered if something other than water could turn the wheel. I particularly liked the way Newton s thoughts are shown through both words and illustrations. These illustrations make it clear to the reader why something might work better. This book is written in the graphic novel format, a favorite of mine! It makes it perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on will also enjoy the graphics and fast-paced text. The full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. Vocabulary has been well selected and this book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or as a source for research. At the end of the book, the author includes several pages with more facts, a glossary, a Read More section, Internet sites, a bibliography and an index. This book should be in all science classrooms, school libraries, and home reference collections. I highly recommend this book. --Children's Literature Comprehensive Database, January 2007</p><h2>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages (Pragmatic Programmers)</h2><p><p>You should learn a programming language every year, as recommended by <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>. But if one per year is good, how about <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</i>? In this book you'll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, and Ruby. Whether or not your favorite language is on that list, you'll broaden your perspective of programming by examining these languages side-by-side. You'll learn something new from each, and best of all, you'll learn how to learn a language quickly.<br><br>Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell. With <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks,</i> by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, <i>Seven Languages</i> hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages.<br><br>For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them.<br><br>Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.<br><br>Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.<br><br>It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.</p></p><p><p>Bruce Tate runs RapidRed, an Austin, TX-based practice that consults on lightweight development in Ruby.

After reading Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, I am starting to understand how to evaluate languages for their objective strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, I feel as if I could pick one of them to actually get some work done.""--Chris Kappler, Senior scientist Raytheon, BBN Technologies<br><br></p><p>""I spent most of my time as a computer sciences student saying I didn't want to be a software developer and then became one anyway. Seven Languages in Seven Weeks expanded my way of thinking about problems and reminded me what I love about programming.""--Travis Kaspar, Software engineer, Northrop Grumman<br><br></p><p>""Do you want seven kick starts into learning your "language of the year"? Do you want your thinking challenged about programming in general? Look no further than this book. I personally was taken back in time to my undergraduate computer science days, coasting through my programming languages survey course. The difference is that Bruce won't let you coast through this course! This isn't a leisurely read--you'll have to work this book. I believe you'll find it both mindblowing and intensely practical at the same time.""--Matt Stine Group leader, Research Application Development, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</p></p><h2>Intelligence in Nature: An Inquiry into Knowledge</h2><p>Continuing the journey begun in his acclaimed book <i>The Cosmic Serpent</i>, the noted anthropologist ventures firsthand into both traditional cultures and the most up-todate discoveries of contemporary science to determine nature's secret ways of knowing.<br><br>Anthropologist Jeremy Narby has altered how we understand the Shamanic cultures and traditions that have undergone a worldwide revival in recent years. Now, in one of his most extraordinary journeys, Narby travels the globe-from the Amazon Basin to the Far East-to probe what traditional healers and pioneering researchers understand about the intelligence present in all forms of life.<br><br><i>Intelligence in Nature</i> presents overwhelming illustrative evidence that independent intelligence is not unique to humanity alone. Indeed, bacteria, plants, animals, and other forms of nonhuman life display an uncanny penchant for self-deterministic decisions, patterns, and actions.<br><br>Narby presents the first in-depth anthropological study of this concept in the West. He not only uncovers a mysterious thread of intelligent behavior within the natural world but also probes the question of what humanity can learn from nature's economy and knowingness in its own search for a saner and more sustainable way of life.</p><p><b>Jeremy Narby, Ph.D.</b> is the author of <b>The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge</b>. He lives in Switzerland.In <i>The Cosmic Serpent</i>, anthropologist Narby hypothesized that Amazonian shamans can "gain access in their visions to information related to DNA" comparable to what molecular biologists know. In this intriguing treatise, he carries his project of syncretizing all forms of knowledge a step further, arguing that animals and plants exhibit intelligence comparable in many ways to that of humans. His shaman friends heartily endorse the idea, regaling him, over a friendly pot of hallucinogenic <i>ayahuasca</i> brew, with conversations they have had in the trance state with animal and plant spirits. For further confirmation, he talks to Western scientists who have done remarkable research on cases of nonhuman intelligence, like bees with abstract reasoning, crows that manufacture standardized tools, pigeons that distinguish between the works of Van Gogh and Chagall about as well as college students do, octopuses that break out of and into their tanks and slime molds that solve mazes. Scientists may find Narby's ongoing efforts to assimilate shamanic mysticism to Western science - he associates, for example, Amazonian legends about humans turning into jaguars with Darwin's theory of evolution - na�ve and illogical. But Narby has done his homework - the endnotes themselves make excellent reading - and his well-researched and engagingly presented account of the "braininess" of even literally brainless creatures raises fascinating questions about the boundaries between man and nature. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Then, letting the breath out, take in the lower abdomen, place the head in the region between the two knees, straighten the knees, and stay in position, doing <i>puraka</i> and <i>rechaka</i> as much as possible; this is the 2nd <i>vinyasa (see figure).</i>2 Next, inhaling, slowly lift the head, remaining in position with the fingers holding the big toes; this is the 3rd <i>vinyasa</i>. Then exhale and return to <i>Samasthiti</i>. While in the state of this <i>asana</i>, the lower abdomen should be drawn in and held tightly, and <i>rechaka</i> and <i>puraka</i> should be done slowly and as much as possible.

He is independent&#x2014;choosing his own path on his motorcycle, living life on his own terms. He is outspoken&#x2014;he has boldly criticized injustices in American law and society despite the backlash this has evoked from the establishment. Yet the element that he finds most important, most sacred, most American, is freedom.</p><p>In <em>Freedom</em>, Sonny articulates many of the principles he employs in his own life. Whether he is regarded as a leader, a rebel, a revolutionary, a criminal, or a soldier, Sonny's outlook has been influenced not just by school but by the military, prison, and his experiences riding with the world's most notorious motorcycle club. It was on these various journeys that he learned the lessons that are most important in his life and the qualities he respects when he sees them in others:</p><blockquote><p>Independence<br>Customize Yourself; Originals Don't Come Off an Assembly Line</p><p>Toughness<br>Temper the Steel to Forge a Strong Blade</p><p>Fairness<br> Treat Me Good, I'll Treat You Better; Treat Me Bad, I'll Treat You Worse</p></blockquote><p>Presented in the form of fifty credos, this book gives Sonny Barger's perspective on how to live a life that embodies the most fundamental of American virtues: freedom.</p></p><p><p>Ralph "Sonny" Barger is the author of <em>Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club</em>.

The iconoclastic author of the memoir <i>Hell's Angels </i>and the novel <i>Dead in 5 Heartbeats</i> now offers a useful guide to maintaining personal freedoms and self-respect on streets mean and otherwise. As might be expected, Miss Manners and Dale Carnegie are left in the dust (with precepts such as "screw fightin' fair") as the fiercely independent Barger rolls out his practical, mostly straight-arrow advice, beginning with a warning: "When you break new earth, you'll instantly be considered an outsider." His experiences in the military, prison and on the road have not only shaped Barger's personal philosophy, they serve as his primary metaphors, e.g., "Life is one long boot camp and only extreme and strenuous life experience can turn you into the complete soldier." In addition to tips on confronting bullies, Barger covers everything from survival skills and self-reliance to teamwork and trust ("My friends are my family"). While many of Barger's 50 precepts are standard self-help fare, rudderless teens needing lessons in confidence, courage, honesty and individuality may find Barger more of a kindred spirit than, say, the <i>Chicken Soup</i> purveyors <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This first English translation shows us one of the most original and important French philosophers of the twentieth century in intimate confrontation with one of that century&#x2019;s most original and important painters.&nbsp;<br><br>In considering Bacon, Deleuze offers implicit and explicit insights into the origins and development of his own philosophical and aesthetic ideas, ideas that represent a turning point in his intellectual trajectory. First published in French in 1981, <i>Francis Bacon</i> has come to be recognized as one of Deleuze&#x2019;s most significant texts in aesthetics. Anticipating his work on cinema, the baroque, and literary criticism, the book can be read not only as a study of Bacon&#x2019;s paintings but also as a crucial text within Deleuze&#x2019;s broader philosophy of art.&nbsp;<br><br>In it, Deleuze creates a series of philosophical concepts, each of which relates to a particular aspect of Bacon&#x2019;s paintings but at the same time finds a place in the &#x201c;general logic of sensation.&#x201d; Illuminating Bacon&#x2019;s paintings, the nonrational logic of sensation, and the act of painting itself, this work&#x2014;presented in lucid and nuanced translation&#x2014;also points beyond painting toward connections with other arts such as music, cinema, and literature. <i>Francis Bacon</i> is an indispensable entry point into the conceptual proliferation of Deleuze&#x2019;s philosophy as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>Gilles Deleuze (1925&#x2013;1995) was professor of philosophy at the University of Paris, Vincennes&#x2013;St. Denis.

The boy seeks refuge with "The Lady"?the statue that is being built as a gift from the French to the American people. He visits so often that workers let him help with small tasks and the sculptor himself, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, allows Andre to help hammer out the copper that becomes the statue's little finger. When it is finally time to ship her to America, Andre decides to stow away. When a storm threatens the safety of the statue and the ship itself, the boy reveals himself to report the loose cargo. He tells the captain how he was inspired by what The Lady stands for and his dream of becoming a coppersmith, and the man takes pity on him and allows him to work as a cabin boy in exchange for passage. The tone of this book is not always convincing, especially during Andre's musings on freedom, but it is a good introduction to historical fiction, and offers a story about one of our national symbols from an interesting point of view. The watercolor illustrations, done mostly in browns and grays, help to convey the time and place, and are actually better than most found in beginning readers.?Carrie Schadle, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kitchen Madonna</h2><p>Marta is unhappy. For quietly aloof Gregory and his sister Janet, Marta, with her thick Ukrainian accent, her good cooking, and her stories, is the anchor of the house. Mother and Father, both busy architects, are gone all day and sometimes at night. Marta is always there; and the children, sensing her unhappiness, do not want her to go away. When they find out that Marta desires a &#x201c;good place&#x201d; in the kitchen, nine-year-old Gregory, with precocious young Janet in tow, sets out to find her a Ukrainian icon in busy, modern London. Master storyteller Rumer Godden deftly brings to life a portrait of a lonely boy discovering the creative power of love.&nbsp;<b>Illustrated.</b></p><p>Margaret Rumer Godden, born in 1907 in Sussex, England, spent most of her younger years in India, where her parents gave her and her two sisters many opportunities to mingle with Indian people while educating their daughters at home. Both parents&#39; gift of storytelling would kindle similar gifts, developed even further, in their children. In those early years there was all the time in the world to think, Rumer Godden said. Even our lessons were at a slow pace. Later, in England, young Miss Godden was encouraged in her writing talent by perceptive instructors at a school called Moira House. Having taken training in dance, Rumer Godden returned to India and opened a ballet school for both British and Indian children. After an unhappy marriage that left her in financial debt she and her daughters retreated to a cottage in the mountains of Kashmir. There she worked hard writing novels, drawing from the many experiences of both her worlds, European and Indian. By the 1940s Rumer Godden was becoming an acclaimed author. In the course of a lifetime she would write over 60 books and be named a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In the 1940s Rumer Godden returned to England. Here she began to write books for children with all the craftsmanship she dedicated to her adult novels. She is perhaps best known for her stories about dolls, a series, that is, according to May Hill Arbuthnot, unsurpassed in variety and charm, for her dolls have distinct personalities and in her books they talk and act in character (Children and Books). In The Kitchen Madonna we see Miss Godden&#39;s perennial interest in those individuals with a special contribution to make who do not fit easily into simple categories. Ruth Hill Viguers writes, Rumer Godden&#39;s intuitive understanding of children that gives such special life to her books about children was never more evident than it is in The Kitchen Madonna (A Critical History of Children&#39;s Literature).Continuing to write, and succeed, in many fields including adaptation to the screen, Miss Godden remained in the British Isles, becoming a Roman Catholic, marrying happily a second time, and retiring eventually in Scotland. She died in 1998.

The kindest thing that can be said of it is that postponed World War II by one year. Its real effect was to convince Hitler and Mussolini that Britain was weak and afraid of confrontation, encouraging them to ever-greater acts of aggression. The turning point of the Czech crisis in September 1938 came when Wilson saw Hitler on his own and left him convinced that Britain was bluffing and would not go to war to defend Czechoslovakia. The dismemberment of Czechoslovakia that followed was not the end of appeasement. The Anglo-German Declaration was Chamberlain&#x2019;s personal vanity project but both Chamberlain and Wilson believed that it genuinely brought "peace for our time."<br><br> Chamberlain and Wilson blindly pursued bilateral friendship between Britain and the dictators and ferociously resisted alternative policies such as working with France, the Soviet Union, or the U.S. to face down the dictators. They resisted all-out rearmament which would have put the economy on a war footing. These were all the policies advocated by Winston Churchill, the most dangerous opponent of appeasement. Churchill was a hated figure for Chamberlain and Wilson. They could not accept Churchill&#x2019;s perception that that Hitler was the implacable enemy of peace and Britain, and opposing him became an end in itself for them. Churchill and Wilson had been bitter adversaries since early in their careers because of an incident that <em>Fighting Churchill, Appeasing Hitler</em> reveals publicly for the first time. Chamberlain had a fraught relationship with Churchill long before appeasement became an issue.<br><br> Neither Chamberlain nor Wilson had any experience of day-to-day practical diplomacy. Both thought that the dictators would apply the same standards of rationality and clarity to the policies of Italy and Germany that applied in Britain. They could not grasp that Fascist demagogues operated in an entirely different way to democratic politicians. The catastrophe of the Chamberlain/Wilson appeasement policy offers a vital lesson in how blind conviction in one policy as the only alternative can be fatally damaging. 8 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Adrian Phillips is the author of The King Who Had to Go: Edward VIII, Mrs. Simpson, and the Hidden Politics of the Abdication Crisis.

And yet the republic soon found itself losing an escalating military conflict on its borderlands. In 1791, years of skirmishes, raids, and quagmire climaxed in the grisly defeat of American militiamen by a brilliantly organized confederation of Shawnee, Miami, and Delaware Indians. With nearly one thousand U.S. casualties, this was the worst defeat the nation would ever suffer at native hands. Americans were shocked, perhaps none more so than their commander in chief, George Washington, who saw in the debacle an urgent lesson: the United States needed an army. </p><p><i>Autumn of the Black Snake</i> tells the overlooked story of how Washington achieved his aim. In evocative and absorbing prose, William Hogeland conjures up the woodland battles and the hardball politics that formed the Legion of the United States, our first true standing army. His memorable portraits of leaders on both sides&#x2015;from the daring war chiefs Blue Jacket and Little Turtle to the doomed commander Richard Butler and a steely, even ruthless Washington&#x2015;drive a tale of horrific violence, brilliant strategizing, stupendous blunders, and valorous deeds. This sweeping account, at once exciting and dark, builds to a crescendo as Washington and Alexander Hamilton, at enormous risk, outmaneuver Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other skeptics of standing armies&#x2015;and Washington appoints the seemingly disreputable Anthony Wayne, known as Mad Anthony, to lead the legion. Wayne marches into the forests of the Old Northwest, where the very Indians he is charged with defeating will bestow on him, with grudging admiration, a new name: the Black Snake.</p><p><i>Autumn of the Black Snake</i> is a dramatic work of military and political history, told in a colorful, sometimes startling blow-by-blow narrative. It is also an original interpretation of how greed, honor, political beliefs, and vivid personalities converged on the killing fields of the Ohio valley, where the United States Army would win its first victory, and in so doing destroy the coalition of Indians who came closer than any, before or since, to halting the nation&#x2019;s westward expansion.</p></p><p><b>William Hogeland </b>is the author of three books on founding U.S. history&#x2015;<i>The Whiskey Rebellion</i>, <i>Declaration</i>, and <i>Founding Finance</i>&#x2015;as well as a collection of essays, <i>Inventing American History</i>.

Hogeland shows how the annihilation of a large American force by a confederation of tribes caused the stoic George Washington to cry out in rage and led to the formation of the Legion of the United States which became the foundation of the American Army. He argues that this struggle is an ominous prequel to Imperial America, as greed, nationalism, and ambition swirl through a cast of amazing characters.

In brief and concise terms, author William Strunk, Jr., identifies the principal requirements of proper American English style and concentrates on the most often violated rules of composition.<br>Originally published in 1918, this authoritative and engagingly written manual retains its immediacy and relevance. Strunk begins with the basic rules of usage, offering accessible explanations of correct punctuation and grammar. His advice on the principles of composition cites concrete examples of how to maintain clarity by eliminating redundancy and unnecessary embellishment. In addition, Strunk provides valuable pointers on avoiding common errors in the usage of words and expressions, and in spelling. The greatest book of its kind, this volume is a must for any student or writer.</p><p>William Strunk Jr. (1 July 1869 26 September 1946) was a professor of English at Cornell University and author of the The Elements of Style (1918), which, after being revised and enlarged by his former student E. B. White, became a highly influential guide to English usage during the late 20th century. <p> Strunk was born and reared in Cincinnati, Ohio, the eldest of four surviving children of William and Ella Garretson Strunk. He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Cincinnati in 1890 and a PhD at Cornell University in 1896. He spent the academic year 1898 99 at the Sorbonne and the Coll�ge de France, where he studied morphology and philology. </p> <p> Strunk first taught mathematics at Rose Polytechnical Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1890 91. He then taught English at Cornell for 46 years, disdaining specialization and becoming expert in both classical and non-English literature. In 1922 he published English Metres, a study of poetic metrical form, and he compiled critical editions of Cynewulf's Juliana, several works of Dryden, James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans, and several Shakespearean plays. Strunk was also active in a gathering known as the Manuscript Club., an "informal Saturday-night gathering of students and professors interested in writing," where he met Elwyn Brooks White. </p> <p> In 1935 36, Strunk enjoyed serving as the literary consultant for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Romeo and Juliet (1936). </p> <p> In 1918, Strunk privately published The Elements of Style for the use of his Cornell students, who gave it its nickname, "the little book." Strunk intended the guide "to lighten the task of instructor and student by concentrating attention...on a few essentials, the rules of usage and principles of composition most commonly violated. In 1935, Strunk and Edward A. Tenney revised and published the guide as The Elements and Practice of Composition (1935). </p> <p> In his New Yorker column of July 27, 1957, E. B. White praised the "little book" as a "forty-three-page summation of the case for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English." Macmillan and Company then commissioned White to revise The Elements of Style for republication. White's expansion and modernization of the 1935 edition sold more than two million copies. Since 1959, total sales of three editions in four decades has exceeded ten million copies.</p></p><h2>My Wonderful World Of Slapstick</h2><p>Buster Keaton&#39;s autobiography is a view into the quirky mind behind the stoic face of the legendary film comedian.</p><p>Keaton&#39;s autobiography, My Wonderful World of Slapstick, is our only record of the quirky mind behind the stoic face.

A young jazz buff in Tokyo. A crooked British lawyer in Hong Kong. A disc jockey in Manhattan. A physicist in Ireland. An elderly woman running a tea shack in rural China. A cult-controlled terrorist in Okinawa. A musician in London. A transmigrating spirit in Mongolia. What is the common thread of coincidence or destiny that connects the lives of these nine souls in nine far-flung countries, stretching across the globe from east to west? What pattern do their linked fates form through time and space?<br><br>A writer of pyrotechnic virtuosity and profound compassion, a mind to which nothing human is alien, David Mitchell spins genres, cultures, and ideas like gossamer threads around and through these nine linked stories. Many forces bind these lives, but at root all involve the same universal longing for connection and transcendence, an axis of commonality that leads in two directions&#x2014;to creation and to destruction. In the end, as lives converge with a fearful symmetry, <i>Ghostwritten</i> comes full circle, to a point at which a familiar idea&#x2014;that whether the planet is vast or small is merely a matter of perspective&#x2014;strikes home with the force of a new revelation. It marks the debut of a writer of astonishing gifts.</p><p>"What is real and what is not?" David Mitchell's <i>Ghostwritten: A Novel in Nine Parts</i> plays with precisely this question throughout its elaborately compartmentalized narrative. (That there are 10 chapters in this 9-part invention is just one more aspect of the author's mysterious schema.) With its multitude of voices and globe-girdling locations--Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Petersburg, London--this first novel offers readers a vertiginous, sometimes seductive, display of persona and place.<p> At the heart of Mitchell's book is the global extension of the postmodern city, and the networks (cultural, technological, phantasmagoric) to which it gives rise. A metropolis like Tokyo is quite literally beyond our comprehension: </p><blockquote> Twenty million people live and work in Tokyo. It's so big that nobody really knows where it stops. It's long since filled up the plain, and now it's creeping up the mountains to the west and reclaiming land from the bay in the east. The city never stops rewriting itself. In the time one street guide is produced, it's already become out of date. It's a tall city, and a deep one, as well as a spread-out one. </blockquote> At this level, urban sprawl becomes an epistemological condition. On one hand it leads to a Japanese death cult, purging the "unclean" from the city's subway with nerve gas. And on the other, it produces a certain splintering of the human personality. "I'm this person, I'm this person, I'm that person, I'm that person too," chants Neal, the narrator of the book's second part. "No wonder it's all such a ... mess." He's talking about his life as a Hong Kong trader, a "man of departments, compartments, apartments." But he might also be describing the experience of reading <i>Ghostwritten</i>. At once loquacious and knowing, leisurely and frantic, Mitchell offers a huge, but fragmentary, portmanteau. And while he's labored diligently to solder together the many parts--the aching bodies, the reality police, the impossibly complex machinery of contemporary life--his novel, too, may suffer from an excess of split personality. <i>--Vicky Lebeau</i>"Mitchell... has a gift for fiction's natural pleasures&#x2013;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices...

Based on nearly three decades of legal research with volunteers, William A. Richards argues that, if used responsibly and legally, psychedelics have the potential to assuage suffering and constructively affect the quality of human life.<br><br>Richards's analysis contributes to social and political debates over the responsible integration of psychedelic substances into modern society. His book serves as an invaluable resource for readers who, whether spontaneously or with the facilitation of psychedelics, have encountered meaningful, inspiring, or even disturbing states of consciousness and seek clarity about their experiences. Testing the limits of language and conceptual frameworks, Richards makes the most of experiential phenomena that stretch our understanding of reality, advancing new frontiers in the study of belief, spiritual awakening, psychiatric treatment, and social well-being. His findings enrich humanities and scientific scholarship, expanding work in philosophy, anthropology, theology, and religious studies and bringing depth to research in mental health, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology.</p><p>The surprising results of formal investigations into the visionary and mystical experiences and the physical, mental, and spiritual effects of psychedelic drugs.William A.

Our heroes have one battle under their belts, and they&#x2019;ve even found a surprising ally in Jabba the Puppett. But to defeat the Dark Standardized Testing Forces they&#x2019;re going to need an even bigger, even more surprising ally: Principal Rabbski.

He is married to author-illustrator Cece Bell and lives in Christiansburg, Virginia.At McQuarrie Middle School, the war against FunTime (the euphemistically named standardized test-prep program) continues, but it seems the Origami Rebel Alliance&#x2019;s previous victory may be short-lived. Despite Principal Rabbski&#x2019;s promise to replace FunTime with extracurriculars, it&#x2019;s still being shown in class! Desperate times call for desperate measures, and someone has decided to take matters into his or her own hand puppet. Princess Labelmaker makes her daring debut by stealing the rebels&#x2019; secret case file and giving it to the principal, an act that could prove their salvation or their demise. Plastered with Labelmaker&#x2019;s commentary, the latest file offers insight into the nobility of the rebels&#x2019; cause and the self-serving designs of FunTime&#x2019;s creators. This continues the characteristic spirit and humor readers have come to expect of the Origami Yoda series. In what may be their greatest challenge yet, Angleberger puts the Alliance to the test in more ways than one. But perhaps the greatest mystery of all is this: Just whose hand is behind Princess Labelmaker? HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: These books are more popular than a working droid on Tatooine.

No surprise there. Marge O&#x2019;Malley was a security guard, but all she did most days was follow me around, waiting for me to cause trouble. I saw her slinking after me all the time. She&#x2019;d always try to hide behind rocks and trees and stuff, but it was never hard to spot her, because Marge was built like a rhinoceros.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in big trouble this time, Teddy,&#x201d; she snarled. She was making a big show of apprehending me in front of a crowd of tourists, shoving me up against the rail of the chimp exhibit and frisking me for weapons&#x2014;like I was a mugger in some urban back alley instead of a twelve-year-old boy at FunJungle, the newest, most family-friendly theme park in the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you arrest some real criminals for once?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right now, you&#x2019;re the only person I see making trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;re not paying attention.&#x201d; It was true. Half the park guests broke the rules. There were signs posted everywhere telling them not to feed the animals, or bang on the glass of their exhibits, or harass them in any way, but they all did it anyhow. Only ten feet from where Marge was patting me down, an entire family was pelting a baby chimp with peanuts. They weren&#x2019;t trying to feed it&#x2014;which would have been bad enough. (The animals had very restricted diets to keep them from getting sick.) They were laughing every time they hit it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch this,&#x201d; said the dad. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet I can hit him right in the head.&#x201d;<br> <br>Right as he was about to let fly, though, a huge red water balloon sailed out of the chimp exhibit and nailed him in the face. It exploded on contact, drenching him.<br> <br>Before he could recover, another balloon hit him. And another. And another. The chimps were fighting back, just as I&#x2019;d hoped. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;d armed them. If the security guards weren&#x2019;t going to protect the animals, then I figured I ought to help the animals protect themselves. After all, how would you like it if someone banged on your windows and chucked peanuts at you all day?<br> <br>Within seconds, the whole chimpanzee troop was lobbing balloons, howling with delight as they pelted the family from all sides. The family stumbled about, slipping in the water and spluttering for air&#x2014;and now everyone was laughing at them.<br> <br>Well, everyone but Large Marge, who was born without a sense of humor. She whipped out her radio and alerted headquarters. &#x201c;HQ, this is O&#x2019;Malley. We have a water-balloon situation at Monkey Mountain. I&#x2019;ve apprehended the perpetrator, Mr. Theodore Fitzroy, but I need backup.&#x201d; Marge always spoke like she&#x2019;d seen way too many cop movies.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never mind that,&#x201d; the dispatcher responded. &#x201c;Get over to Hippo River. We&#x2019;re getting reports that something&#x2019;s wrong there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marge frowned, though not out of concern for the hippos; she was annoyed her request for backup had been ignored. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you appreciate the magnitude of the situation here. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is coming straight from Buck,&#x201d; the dispatcher said, meaning Buck Grassley, the chief of FunJungle&#x2019;s security. &#x201c;Hippo River is a Code Red. If you&#x2019;re at Monkey Mountain, you&#x2019;re the closest to the scene. So get over there now. &#x201d;<br> <br>Marge snapped upright and jammed her radio back in its holster. The idea that there was an actual emergency had stirred something inside her. She grabbed my ear and dragged me toward the exit. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think this saves your bacon, mister. You&#x2019;re still in trouble for what you did to that poor family.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That family ought to thank me,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t given the chimps water balloons, they&#x2019;d have thrown poop .&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t making that up. I&#x2019;d seen chimps defend themselves in the wild by throwing their own feces. But as usual, trying to explain anything to Marge was useless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch your language or I&#x2019;ll wash your mouth with soap,&#x201d; she snapped.<br> <br>The family that had been bombarded with balloons stormed out of Monkey Mountain right behind us, so soaked that their shoes sloshed. &#x201c;See if we ever come to this park again!&#x201d; the mother announced indignantly.<br> <br>Good riddance, I thought, stifling a smile.<br> <br>The truth was, except for Marge&#x2019;s vice-grip on my ear, I was happy to be heading to Hippo River. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what a Code Red meant, but it promised to be interesting. Maybe some clumsy tourist had fallen into the exhibit and needed to be rescued. Technically, that was probably a bad thing to hope for: Most people don&#x2019;t realize that hippos are actually the second most dangerous African animals. (Water buffalo are the first.) They&#x2019;re mean, they&#x2019;re unpredictable, and they have razor-sharp teeth a foot long. In the wild, they&#x2019;ve been known to stomp lions to death and bite crocodiles in half. If someone fell into the hippos&#x2019; territory, they&#x2019;d be screwed. But after a few weeks at FunJungle, I was bored out of my skull and willing to take excitement anywhere I could find it.<br> <br>That might seem pretty surprising, given that I spent every day at a place that claimed to be &#x201c;America&#x2019;s Most Exciting Family Vacation Destination.&#x201d; FunJungle was the biggest, most elaborate zoo ever built and it had been jam-packed since it had opened two weeks before. But unlike the thousands of other kids who visited every day, I didn&#x2019;t go home when they closed the park at night. I was home.<br> <br>Both my parents worked there. My mom was a famous gorilla researcher. My dad was a renowned wildlife photographer. (They&#x2019;d met when National Geographic had sent him to photograph Mom&#x2019;s gorillas.) Now Mom oversaw the care and research of all FunJungle&#x2019;s primates while Dad worked for the publicity department, taking glamour shots of the animals for websites and magazines.<br> <br>FunJungle had been built way out in Texas Hill Country, where land was cheap; the closest city, San Antonio, was more than half an hour away. So the park had provided housing for my family and a few other animal specialists who&#x2019;d come to work there: Our mobile homes sat just beyond the back fence. None of the other specialists had children, though, which meant I was the only kid for thirty miles in any direction.<br> <br>Now, don&#x2019;t go thinking I was bored because I don&#x2019;t like animals. I do. In fact, I bet I know more about animals than any twelve-year-old you&#x2019;ve met. I spent the first decade of my life living in a tent in the African Congo. I didn&#x2019;t see a TV until I was six; instead, I watched animals&#x2014;and Mom and Dad taught me everything they knew. I learned how to track elephants, communicate with chimps, and defend myself against a hungry leopard. Heck, I learned about animals you&#x2019;ve probably never even heard of: bongos, hammerkops, Gaboon vipers, guenons. My first friend was a gorilla my age named Mfuzi. I loved being around animals every day.<br> <br>I was bored because, until not long before, I&#x2019;d had an amazingly exciting life. Living in the Congo was one incredible experience after another&#x2014;and when I did leave the jungle, it was always to visit fascinating places with my father on his assignments. Dad was a real adrenaline junkie and he encouraged me to embrace adventure: We&#x2019;d rappelled into caves to find giant bats in Mexico, stalked tigers in Uttar Pradesh, and even snorkeled with blue whales off Fiji.<br> <br>But then, right after I turned ten, a civil war broke out in the Congo and my parents decided it was no longer safe to raise me there. (If not for me, they probably would have risked their lives to stay with the gorillas.) Mom grabbed the first job she could find back in the States, a research position at Emory Primate Labs in Atlanta, but that was a bust. None of us were happy in Georgia; we all missed Africa terribly. So when my folks were offered work at FunJungle, which billed itself as &#x201c;the closest you can get in America to being on safari,&#x201d; we figured living there might be more fun for all of us.<br> <br>And for a while, it was. FunJungle was by far the best zoo in the world. All the reviews said so. It was three times larger than the next biggest zoo, its exhibits were innovative and there was plenty to do. But it still wasn&#x2019;t the Congo. After a few weeks, to keep myself amused, I&#x2019;d had to resort to playing practical jokes, like giving the chimps water balloons&#x2014;or switching the signs on the men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s restrooms&#x2014;or replacing all the black jellybeans in Large Marge&#x2019;s lunch with rabbit poop.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why I was fine with letting myself be dragged along to Hippo River. I was only hoping for a little excitement.<br> <br>It never occurred to me that Henry would be dead.<br> <br><br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t occur to Marge either. She shoved through the crowd at Mbuko Hippo Overlook, still dragging me by my ear, flashing her little tin badge&#x2014;and suddenly, there Henry was, lying in the shallow water of his enclosure, all four legs pointing straight at the sky.<br> <br>Most of Henry&#x2014;and there was about 4,000 pounds of him&#x2014;was underwater, resting on the bottom of his pool. I couldn&#x2019;t see his body, since the water was clouded with hippo poop, as usual. Only his feet were visible, jutting above the surface, pale white now that the blood had drained from them. They were thick and stubby, looking like giant, moldy marshmallows floating in day-old hot chocolate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that cute?&#x201d; a mother asked her children. &#x201c;Henry&#x2019;s sleeping upside down!&#x201d;<br> <br>Marge&#x2019;s grip finally relaxed on my ear. She was so stunned, she&#x2019;d forgotten about me. Instead, she stared at Henry vacantly, not knowing what to do.<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t the only one. There was always a crowd at Mbuko Hippo Overlook, but today it was more packed than usual. Maybe word had got out that Henry had kicked the bucket and some folks had come running to see, but most of the visitors appeared to have been caught by surprise. They just stood there, gaping at those feet, unable to believe Henry the Hippo was dead.<br> <br>I admit I was pretty shocked myself. Since FunJungle had more than five thousand animals on display, you expected things would go wrong now and then. Every day, dozens of animals got sick; maybe even one or two would die. But for Henry to go belly-up . . . that was pretty much the worst-case scenario, given that he was the park&#x2019;s mascot.<br> <br>FunJungle had been advertising all over the world for a year before it opened, and every one of those ads&#x2014;every TV commercial, radio spot, and billboard&#x2014;featured Henry. Well, not the actual Henry, but a cartoon version of him who said corny things like &#x201c;Come visit FunJungle! It&#x2019;s more fun than a barrel of monkeys . . . and I ought to know!&#x201d; Cartoon Henry didn&#x2019;t look much like the real Henry&#x2014;he was skinny, purple, and friendly, while the real Henry was fat, gray, and mean&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t seem to bother the tourists. Henry was famous, so they flocked to see him. It was bizarre. There was a far more interesting hippo, Henrietta, in the exhibit right next to Henry&#x2019;s, but most guests didn&#x2019;t give her a second glance. Henrietta could&#x2019;ve done backflips and everyone would still be packed ten deep to watch Henry nap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wake up, Henry! It&#x2019;s time to get up!&#x201d; a little boy near me yelled. Several other boys decided this was a good idea and joined in.<br> <br>Their parents looked at one another blankly. Cartoon Henry had told them all that a day at FunJungle was supposed to be &#x201c;nonstop family fun&#x201d;; explaining the circle of life and death threatened to be quite the opposite.<br> <br>&#x201c;Johnny, please,&#x201d; said one mother. Her son was happily proving he could chant the loudest. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Henry is going to wake up. Hippos are very sound sleepers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; a queasy-looking father added. &#x201c;Plus, his ears are underwater.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hippo River was the most popular exhibit at FunJungle, though this wasn&#x2019;t only because of Henry. It was right by the main entrance&#x2014;the first thing visitors saw as they came through the front gates&#x2014;and it was pretty spectacular. (As it should have been. I heard FunJungle had spent more than thirty million dollars on it.) The exhibit took up ten acres&#x2014;and once you entered it, it was really like being in Africa. You started at a thundering 150-foot waterfall, then hiked through a jungle filled with birds and monkeys, visiting scenic viewpoints from which you could see flocks of flamingos, huge Nile crocodiles&#x2014;and, of course, the hippos. Each viewpoint had a quaint name that had been designed by a computer to sound African, even though they meant absolutely nothing: Ngodongo Gorge, Lallabasi Basin, Wullumon Camp.<br> <br>The real draw at Hippo River, however, was the underwater viewing areas: places where you could watch the hippos through huge glass walls. This wasn&#x2019;t a revolutionary idea: Lots of zoos had similar exhibits for viewing polar bears&#x2014;and a few even had ones for hippos. But no one had anything on the scale that FunJungle did.<br> <br>The folks who&#x2019;d designed FunJungle were actually pretty smart about animals; they knew hippopotamuses were far more interesting below water than they were above it. Heck, a lot of the time (and I know this from experience) you can watch the surface for hours and never even see a hippo; they need to breathe only once every ten minutes, and even then, they usually just poke their nostrils out. But underwater, it&#x2019;s a whole different story. Hippos swim, play, eat, give birth, and nurse their young on river bottoms. (Mom told me they also make baby hippos down there, but FunJungle kept Henry and Henrietta separated during visiting hours to make sure this didn&#x2019;t happen in front of the guests.) Plus, while hippos look like big, lazy sacks of fat on land, they&#x2019;re surprisingly graceful in the water. So FunJungle had eight gigantic windows to view them through&#x2014;and even a pricey restaurant where the prime tables were right against the glass; guests could have a fourteen-dollar hamburger and watch hippos swim past a foot away. You can&#x2019;t do that in Africa.<br> <br>Unfortunately, there had been a few glitches with the exhibit. Most obviously, the water filtration system wasn&#x2019;t strong enough. Henry ate nearly a hundred pounds of food a day and sent most of it straight through his digestive tract, clouding the water faster than the filters could clean it. If Henry stayed near the windows, where the water flow was better, you could get a decent, if somewhat hazy, view of him. But Henry preferred to spend his time in a small backwater of his enclosure, wallowing in his own filth. This rendered the underwater viewing areas all but useless. Restaurant patrons ended up eating their fourteen-dollar burgers with nothing to see except sewage.<br> <br>Of course, this was now a relatively minor problem.<br> <br>It was June in Texas, which meant it was ninety-eight degrees in the shade. Under the harsh glare of the sun, Henry was starting to smell worse than usual&#x2014;which was really saying something. Hippos are naturally quite flatulent, but Henry was the worst I&#x2019;d ever encountered; he could emit odors powerful enough to make you nauseated fifty feet away.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not sleeping,&#x201d; a little girl said, wrinkling her nose in disgust. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead!&#x201d;<br> <br>Other parents&#x2019; eyes widened. The girl&#x2019;s parents immediately shriveled under everyone&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;No, he isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; her mother said hopefully. &#x201c;Hippos don&#x2019;t die like that. When hippos die, they float to the top, like goldfish.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; the little girl announced again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go see the elephants,&#x201d; ...</p><h2>Daughter of Narcissus: A Family&#39;s Struggle to Survive Their Mother&#39;s Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2><p>Daughter of Narcissus by Lady Colin Campbell is a stunning analysis and revelatory memoir of her own dysfunctional family positioned at the heart of upper class Jamaican society from the middle of the 20th century to the present day. Addressing the extreme narcissistic personality disorder of her mother, Georgie Campbell s latest book is both a personal, individual record and a penetrating study of this psychological disorder and how it affects and scars all members of the immediate family. Departing from her former studies of contemporary high society, Georgie Campbell has turned her intelligence and insight onto her own past, exposing the emotional truth beneath her family façade of class and privilege. The book interweaves private memories of her mother s destructive behaviour with a detailed analysis of the underlying realities and fantasies of the narcissistic personality. With disarming clarity and hard learnt wisdom, she shows us what motivates the behaviour sof the narcissistic female as she plots and schemes, destructively setting father against children, sibling against sibling and grand-parent against grand-child. The depth of her work can be seen in her inclusion of recent scientific/medial research on the subject, the extensive bibliography and her endorsement by the eminent Dr Anna Brocklebank, who has practised psychiatry and is the legal and medical adviser to the renowned Institute of Clinical Hypnosis. In addition the author interconnects the sociological, political and personal in startling ways. As she covers the end of the British Colonial Age and the rise of a new liberated generation in the 1960s and 1970s, she reveals how these cultural movements impinge on the dynamics and desires within the family Set against a backdrop of wealth and privilege, concealing the destructive and shocking behaviour of the disordered personality, Daughter of Narcissus is disarmingly honest, informed and sometimes disturbing. This compulsive book is not only a fascinating history of one socially prominent international family, but also a uniquely detailed study of narcissism, its manifestations and effects and how to survive them in order to lead a purposeful and affirming life.</p><p>Lady Colin Campbell is a highly successful and prolific author of several books, including London and New York Times bestsellers, and for many years has been a prominent, sometimes confrontational figure in royal and social circles. She perhaps is best known for her international bestselling book Diana in Private, 1992, and her subsequent extended and revelatory biography of the Princess of Wales, The Real Diana published in 2004. Dedicated to exposing human truths and uncomfortable realities which are20often concealed or denied, she has often caused controversy within circles of influence and privilege. She has been a regular columnist and commentator herself, and appeared numerous times on TV and Radio in the UK and in the US as an experienced Royal Insider, expert on the British aristocracy and the lives of those who possess power and wealth. Born in St Andrew, Jamaica, she was educated there and in New York, where she lived for seven years. She is connected to British royalty through common ancestors and marriage. She has two sons and lives and works in London.A penetrating and insightful examination of a serious subject in the form of a memoir which actually raises that medium to new heights. It will enhance the reader s life as much as it elevates the author s reputation, and will achieve the distinction of being a popular bestseller that also becomes a medical reference work. --Dr Anna Brocklebank, MD</p><h2>Title Wave (A Booktown Mystery)</h2><p><b>Tricia and Angelica leave Booktown behind for a pleasure cruise, but they&#x2019;re going to need their life jackets because a murderer is also on board in this mystery in Lorna Barrett&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br><br>While her bookstore, Haven&#x2019;t Got a Clue, is rebuilt following a devastating fire, Tricia Miles and her sister, Angelica, decide to book a cruise for some much needed R &amp; R.

Is the killer a famous mystery author, one of her fans, or a member of the ship&#x2019;s crew? As Tricia tries to find the killer before they reach port, she may be cruising for a bruising...<br><br><b>INCLUDES RECIPES&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Lorna Barrett</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Booktown Mysteries, including <i>Poisoned Pages</i>, <i>A Just Clause</i>, <i>Title Wave</i>, <i>A Fatal Chapter</i>, and <i>Book Clubbed</i>. She lives in Rochester, New York.ONE<br><br>It was almost four in the afternoon, but already it had been a very long day. Too long a day, Tricia Miles decided as she shifted from one foot to the other.<br><br> The day had started many hours before daylight, when she'd awoken to the sounds of her cat, Miss Marple, having a hairball at the end of her bed. She'd managed to whisk the cat off the snowy white spread in time to save it, but that was the end of her rest. Tricia still had so many things to accomplish before she; her sister, Angelica; and many friends and colleagues from the Stoneham Chamber of Commerce boarded a bus and headed for the Big Apple.<br><br> No doubt about it, once the holidays were over, the shops along Stoneham's main drag might as well shut down until April, when the tourists came back in full force. What better time for everyone to take a much-needed vacation? At least, that was the pitch Angelica had given the Chamber members the previous fall when Milford Travel, a new member, had proposed the excursion. The Authors at Sea cruise would be filled with two dozen authors and thousands of their readers. Tricia had spent the previous six winters in Stoneham, with very little in the way of downtime. A vacation to the south that was dedicated to her favorite subject&#x2014;reading&#x2014;had sounded heavenly, but now she felt she needed a vacation from her vacation.<br><br> The weather had held, but the bus had encountered a gigantic traffic jam outside of Boston that had put them more than an hour behind schedule, and so they'd had to cancel their planned breakfast stop. Somebody had suggested they sing to pass the time. A number of the group thought it was great fun, joining in with gusto, but after only a few bottles of beer on the wall, Tricia wished she hadn't packed her iPod in her suitcase and could drown out the revelry.<br><br> Lunch at the 21 Club had been a treat for most of the group, who'd never been there before. But Chamber member Leona Ferguson, who owned Stoneham's Stoneware, looked more than a little green during the bus ride and hadn't had time to admire the restaurant's dishes or have one bite of her salad before she'd made a mad dash to the ladies' room. She'd later admitted that she'd forgotten to wear her motion-sickness patch and made the final leg of the bus journey hyperventilating into a paper bag&#x2014;threatening to upchuck in her seat, which had sent her seatmate scrambling and made the bus driver in front of her break into a cold sweat. But somehow she'd made it to the pier without being sick, and everyone's spirits rose once more. Until they got inside the cavernous&#x2014;and very drafty&#x2014;cruise terminal where most of their group were seated. They were scheduled to board the majestic <i>Celtic Lady</i> at two o'clock, but here it was nearly two hours later and the terminal was still full.<br><br> "What's going on? What's the holdup?" grumbled a male voice behind her.<br><br> Tricia wasn't one of the lucky ones who'd managed to grab a seat, but at least she'd worn sensible shoes. Angelica had been standing in three-inch heels for over two hours. Still, the smile on her face hadn't wavered as she traveled around the group, encouraging everyone to be patient.<br><br> "I don't know how you do it," Tricia muttered as Angelica finished yet another circuit around the group.<br><br> "It's my business face. You've got one, too. The one you use with difficult customers."<br><br> "I don't usually have forty of them at once," Tricia admitted.<br><br> "That's true, but I cope the same way I've always coped. I smile and imagine myself choking the life out of each and every one of them."<br><br> "Everyone?" Tricia prompted, trying to suppress a grin.<br><br> Angelica's gaze drifted over to Antonio Barbero, who stood next to his seated wife, Ginny, and their darling angel of a daughter, Sofia, who was almost six months old. "Maybe not."<br><br> Angelica hadn't told the world at large that Antonio was her stepson. She'd wanted to keep that little piece of information a secret&#x2014;and still did. As far as everyone but Tricia and Ginny knew, the four of them were just very good friends and not related by a marriage that had long ago gone south. Angelica hadn't even spoken to that particular ex-husband in almost two decades, but she'd kept in touch with the son he couldn't be bothered with, and loved Antonio as if he'd been her own child. And they worked well together on the company they'd formed a few years earlier: Nigela Ricita Associates.<br><br> A nervous Mindy Weaver bobbed and weaved around the fringe of her charges. The slight woman must have been in her early forties, and while she'd worked for Milford Travel for at least a decade, this was her first time taking charge of a tour&#x2014;and it showed.<br><br> "Just a little bit longer," she called nervously over the murmur of grumbling voices.<br><br> "These things happen," Chauncey Porter called out, and shrugged. He owned the Armchair Tourist, and Mindy had enlisted his help as her de facto mentor and helpmate on the trip.<br><br> Thanks to Angelica's business advice, Chauncey's once-failing bookshop had done a dramatic turnaround. Where he once sold used travel guides and maps, he'd branched out to stock sundries that anyone taking a trip might need: from suitcase locks to personal GPS devices, and from sunscreen to passport wallets. Chauncey got along well with everyone&#x2014;with one exception: Tricia. He blamed her for the death of his fianc�e some fourteen months before. She'd had no part in the woman's death, but the heart had no concept of logic. Chauncey hadn't spoken to her since that terrible night when he'd slapped her. She could have leveled assault charges, but had simply walked away. She missed his friendship.<br><br> "We've still got a bag full of peppermints if anybody needs them," Muriel Dexter called out.<br><br> "Keeps your breath fresh," her twin sister, Midge, called out.<br><br> Nobody took them up on their offer.<br><br> The elderly spinster Dexter sisters were well known in Stoneham for their rather quirky personalities and the fact that they'd chat amiably to anyone they came in contact with. Somehow the idea of individuality had never occurred to them, for despite their age they liked to dress alike and often had <i>fun </i>switching identities to fool the villagers, who found that antic anything <i>but </i>fun.<br><br> Mary Fairchild, owner of By Hook or By Book, Stoneham's craft and book shop, dodged her way across the open concourse, heading for the rest of the group. She stopped in front of Tricia. "Wow, you'd think in a building this huge they'd have better bathroom facilities. I had to wait in line for more than twenty minutes," she said. Still, Tricia could see by the sparkle in Mary's eyes that the ordeal had not deterred her.<br><br> "You've managed to stay cheerful," she commented.<br><br> "Nothing could faze me today. This is my very first cruise," Mary gushed, "and I intend to enjoy every second of it. And now that I'm single, I'm kind of hoping I meet someone."<br><br> Mary's husband, Luke, had gone to prison for murder. The divorce had come through only a month or so before. Mary was embarking on a whole new life. Tricia could sure identify with that.<br><br> "Are you looking to get married again?" Angelica said, leaning into the conversation.<br><br> "Oh, no. I want to have <i>fun</i>!"<br><br> Angelica laughed. "Well, as a four-time loser in the love department, I can't argue with that reasoning."<br><br> "I'm going to go sit back down. I'm sure glad Leona was saving my seat. I don't know how you girls have stood there for such a long time."<br><br><i> You could let one of us sit for a few minutes</i>, Tricia thought, but didn't voice it. Oh, well.<br><br> At least one other person in the crowd seemed to be having a good time. A thin, gray-haired gentleman of about sixty sat on an electric scooter and zoomed between the various clusters of would-be mariners. A lot of people seemed to know him by name, and he paused to briefly speak with them before he took off for another circuit around the cavernous room. Tricia envied his seat, but not the ailment that had him saddled to the motorized chair.<br><br> A ripple of excitement seemed to go through the crowd, and Tricia and Angelica turned to see a tall, beefy woman whose hair was an alarming shade of red, stride past them in a flowing black cape, while an older, much shorter blonde-haired woman struggled to keep up with her.<br><br> "Isn't that&#x2014;?" someone said.<br><br> "I'm sure it is," another agreed eagerly.<br><br> Whispers and nervous giggles broke out all around them.<br><br> Tricia immediately recognized the woman as thriller author EM Barstow. The woman's reputation for being difficult preceded her. She'd once signed at Tricia's mystery bookstore, Haven't Got a Clue; <i>once</i> being the operative word. The woman had found nothing but fault with the store, the temperature of the coffee, the color of ink in the pens Tricia provided, with her then assistant, Ginny, and her other employee, Mr. Everett, as well. They were clumsy, they were stupid. Didn't they know how to open a book so she could quickly sign it?<br><br> Tricia looked over her shoulder to where Mr. Everett sat with his wife, Grace, and noted that he, too, was not enthused to see the author, and no doubt remembered the temper tantrum the woman had thrown when told that the cab Tricia had ordered to pick her up would be a few minutes late. Didn't they know she was <i>important</i>? Didn't they know she was used to a <i>limousine</i>, not a common cab? Didn't they know <i>anything</i>?<br><br> All eyes were upon EM as she barged ahead of a line of fifty or more passengers who'd finally been called to check in.<br><br> Her shorter companion finally managed to catch up, and EM seemed to be engaged in conversation with the woman behind the check-in desk, who shook her head and pointed to the general waiting area to the right, which was also stuffed to overflowing with weary travelers.<br><br> "Do you <i>know </i>who I am?" EM bellowed loud enough for half the terminal to hear.<br><br> All heads turned in her direction.<br><br> "Someone's not happy," Angelica muttered, raising a perfectly tweezed eyebrow.<br><br> Tricia couldn't hear the cruise terminal worker's reply, but she guessed at EM's howl of outrage that if the woman<i> did</i> know, she didn't care. Unable to suppress a smile, Tricia turned away.<br><br> Mindy finished another circuit around the Stoneham Chamber members.<br><br> "Were you able to find out what the holdup is?" Angelica asked wearily.<br><br> "When the boat docked this morning, passengers were supposed to check in with customs. It seems that four of them simply didn't. It took the crew hours to track them down. No one could reboard until they found them."<br><br> "And where were they?"<br><br> "One was in the spa. Apparently there's a deprivation tank, and she claims she couldn't hear her name repeatedly called over the public-address system."<br><br> "And the others?" Angelica prompted.<br><br> "One had her hearing aids turned off. I'm not sure about the others."<br><br> "Does this mean they're finally going to start letting people board? We're supposed to leave port in an hour," Tricia said.<br><br> Mindy looked across the way at the several thousand people all waiting their turn to check in. "Looks like we'll be a little late," she said nervously.<br><br> "Hey, look!" Chauncey called out. "They're letting the first group go through."<br><br> Sure enough, the gate had opened, and a horde of people lurched forward, dragging their luggage. EM Barstow was <i>not</i> among them. She took a recently vacated seat and, as her expression revealed, fumed.<br><br> It didn't take long before the Stoneham group was called, and everyone proceeded through the gate in an orderly fashion. As head of the Chamber, Angelica went to the back of the line, clucking reassurances to her charges like a mother hen. Tricia hung back, too. After all, they were sharing a stateroom; they might as well find it together.<br><br> Once issued their identification keycards, they passed through security, followed the stragglers, and boarded the magnificent ship. Already the sky was black, and a brisk wind whistled around the gangplank. "I hope we won't have rough seas," Angelica muttered.<br><br> "Do you get seasick?" Tricia asked.<br><br> "Heavens, no&#x2014;I just don't want to fall off my heels."<br><br> "I should think you'd be ready to take them off."<br><br> "I am. But once we're settled, we're finding a nice, quiet bar. I have earned my martini&#x2014;or two&#x2014;for the day."<br><br> "I'll be happy to join you," Tricia agreed.<br><br> A uniformed woman stood at the bank of elevators, advising cruisers how to find their staterooms. She glanced at Angelica's paperwork. "You're on Deck 7." She signaled to a woman in a drab black uniform. "Will you please show these ladies to their stateroom?"<br><br> The young woman nodded and reached for Angelica's large case. "If you'll follow me."<br><br> "Thank you," Angelica said, and smiled.<br><br> They piled into the elevator with what seemed like far too many other people and had to jump out for the first several decks until they reached their own. A handy plaque directed them to the left. They halted in front of a door marked 7150. The uniformed woman stepped forward to open the door, but Angelica waved her away. "We can take it from here."<br><br> "I'd be very happy to help you unpack."<br><br> "No need. Thank you very much."<br><br> The young woman nodded and backed away, then turned to leave.<br><br> "Shouldn't you have tipped her?" Tricia asked.<br><br> "How long has it been since you were on a cruise?"<br><br> "Years."<br><br> "She'll be handsomely tipped&#x2014;it'll be included on our final, itemized bill. We'll also tip our own butler at the end of the trip."<br><br> "We get a butler?"<br><br> "Just one of the perks."<br><br> Angelica turned for the door and slipped her ID card into the slot, and the door opened. As it did, the lights came on inside.<br><br> "Oh, my," Tricia cried as she took in the cabin's interior.<br><br> "I was ready to jump out of my skin thinking someone would spoil my surprise," Angelica cried.<br><br> "I'm surprised, all right," Tricia said, breathless, taking in the opulent stateroom. No, not a stateroom at all; a suite of elegant rooms. "Ange, how can you afford-"<br><br> "Honey, I'm rich," she said, and somehow it didn't even seem like she was bragging. "I work hard. We both do. And who are we going to leave our money to, except each other? And Antonio, Ginny, and Sofia," she quickly amended. "I'm paying for their suite, too."</p><h2>Following Jesus, the Servant King: A Biblical Theology of Covenantal Discipleship (Biblical Theology for Life)</h2><p>Throughout the Old Testament and into the New, God not only demands righteousness from his people but also showers on grace that enables them to act. Jesus, of course, provides the ultimate fulfillment of these twin aspects of God&#x2019;s relationship to humanity. In biblical terms, Jesus is the King who demands righteous obedience from his followers, and Jesus is the Servant who provides the grace that enables this obedience.So what does it mean to follow Jesus?

It describes the role that emotional disturbances play in the most common diseases and ailments from the common cold to arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.<br><br>After providing an introduction to intuitive medicine and its history, method of diagnosis, and relationship to traditional medicine, Myss and Shealy detail the deeper emotional and psychic reasons why illness develops in the body.

According to theologian and "medical intuitive" Caroline Myss, Ph.D., and co-worker C. Norman Shealy, M.D., who is a physician, neurosurgeon, and expert on pain and stress management, the answer goes further than a medical explanation. <i>The Creation of Health</i> explores the emotional, physical, and spiritual patterns that form health and the stresses that can cause disease. <p> Myss identifies eight dysfunctional patterns that lead to illness. Being aware that "negative attitudes create negative responses within the physical body" allows you to make changes toward health after identifying your emotional, psychological, and spiritual stresses. The most interesting chapters discuss specific diseases in terms of lifestyle factors, stress, and psychological patterns and energy factors, with case studies. A heart attack, for example, is "an explosion of energy attempting to break down an emotional barrier ... caused by warehousing fears and anger," says Myss. The authors alternate, rather than co-write, chapters and topics, so you know whose perspective you're reading. The theoretical sections are not easy reading, but the insights you can apply to your own health make the work immensely worthwhile. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Caroline Myss, Ph.D., is an internationally renowned pioneer in energy medicine and the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling books <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i>, <i>Why People Don&#x2019;t Heal and How They Can</i>, and <i>Sacred Contracts</i>.

B. Gutherie, Jr. It was instantly recognized for its insight into the birth of the American South from the early 1700's until the Civil War. Historian Carl Bridenbaugh wrote that "In the last sixteen years of the colonial era, southbound traffic along the Great Philadelphia Wagon Road was numbered in tens of thousands; it was the most heavily travelled road in all America..." and Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson marked its route on their map of Virginia in 1754 as "the great Wagon Road from the Yadkin River through Virginia to Philadelphia distant 435 miles." <p>Over the years the Road led countless Scotch-Irish, Germanic, and English settlers southward from Philadelphia to settle the Appalachian uplands from Pennsylvania to Georgia. Over the Road went the progenitors of John Sevier of Tennessee, John Caldwell Calhoun of South Carolina, Sam Houston of Texas, Cyrus McCormick of Virginia, and other Americans. </p><p>Countless cities and towns from Philadelphia to Augusta, Georgia, owe their beginning to early camp sites along the Road that grew into tavern locations, then into county seats, and then into centers of agriculture and industry. Today such Wagon Road towns as Lancaster, York, and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; Harper's Ferry, West Virginia; Winchester, Newmarket, Harrisonburg, Staunton, Lexington, and Rocky Mount, Virginia; Winston-Salem, Salisbury, and Charlotte, North Carolina; and Newberry and Camden, South Carolina have grown along the onetime settler's trail. </p><p>The Great Wagon Road also tells of Daniel Boone's pioneering from Big Lick, Virginia-now Roanoke-into the territory of Kentucky. Boone Expedited western settlement by cutting a trail across Cumberland Gap on Virginia's frontier to lead settlers in Revolutionary years into dangerous Indian country.</p></p><p></p><h2>Romans (Romans Series) Vol 1: Exposition of Chapter 1 - The Gospel of God</h2><p>No New Testament Epistle is more foundational to the Christian faith than Romans, and no chapter in Romans more basic than its first chapter.

In 1654, Isobel escapes and stows away on a ship bound for Amsterdam, searching for her family. But harrowing adventures lead her to the first group of Jews to settle in America. &#34;Weaves history, drama and narrative into an arresting story.&#34; -New York Times Book Review &#34;An uplifting story built upon twin themes long common to Jewish thought-hope and deliverance.&#34; -Kirkus Reviews Sydney Taylor Honor Book New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age</p><p>Jacqueline Dembar Greene is the award-winning author of more than twenty books and stories for young readers. She has written picture books, historical fiction and folktales and illustrated some of her non-fiction books with original photographs. She is a former teacher and journalist and a frequent speaker to student and adult audiences. Ms. Greene lives in Wayland, MA.Grade 5-8 Greene's novel, based on the Portuguese Inquisition, makes history come alive. Twelve-year-old Isobel is a member of a family of conversos who keep their Judaism hidden. To reeducate Isobel and her sister Maria, friars kidnap both girls and take them to Brazil. Through Isobel's eyes, youngsters experience the anguish of estrangement and the harsh conditions of the slavery in which the children are forced to live. Isobel is shocked when Maria insists that they must hide on separate ships leaving for Amsterdam, but she overcomes her intense fear and goes off on her own. Although Isobel has several close calls, she ultimately reaches safety in New Amsterdam, hopeful that someday she will be reunited with her family. Sometimes her victories are a bit too convenient, but this does not detract from the book's overall appeal. Isobel is a believable character. She is courageous, but her bravery is borne of necessity and a powerful desire to see her family again. In this, she is somewhat reminiscent of Dicey in Cynthia Voigt's Homecoming (Macmillan, 1985) and Mary Call in Vera and Bill Cleaver's Where the Lilies Bloom (Harper, 1969) . Greene has written an engrossing tale about a frightening and shameful period in history. The unfortunate omission of a specific date for the setting could detract from young readers' ease in understanding the book's historical basis. Only the reference to New Amsterdam near the end of the book gives youngsters a frame of reference.

Henry&#x2019;s friends and admirers created an annual book of short stories in his honor, they surely had a different idea than we do today of what constitutes a good story.<br><br> O. Henry was famous for his twist at the end of a tale, the unexpected turn or ironic revelation that made the insoluble problems and puzzles in his plot disappear in a puff of laughter or a few tears. Plots were generally more ornate in the early twentieth century, and so too was literary language. Furthermore, stories such as O. Henry&#x2019;s weren&#x2019;t expected to be ambivalent. The story&#x2019;s meaning, often spelled out as a lesson for the reader, was a natural part of the ending.<br><br> Today, stories come in a greater variety of voices and forms. A story can be written in any tense; in first, second, or third person; composed entirely of dialogue or with no dialogue at all; in one paragraph; in play form; with footnotes; and so on. Sometimes the past of the characters is spelled out and sometimes it is nonexistent, an effort on the writer&#x2019;s part to create an unending present. As for meaning, that&#x2019;s left up to the reader. The short story is now&nbsp;an open field for writers, and some of the results might be unrecognizable to an early-twentieth-century reader. Still, elements of the form persist: a certain relationship between different pieces of the story, in particular, the passionate desire of the beginning and ending for reunion.<br><br>So, too, the inner workings of the collection have changed. The earliest O. Henry Prize stories were chosen by several committees of readers who started with six hundred stories and passed them on in smaller and smaller batches until the final three judges whittled the remaining contenders down to seventeen finalists. Among those seventeen, the judges then ranked three as first-, second-, and third-prize winners.<br><br>The process is much simplified now and fairer to writer and reader. Instead of the cascading sets of readers of the early years, the series editor alone chooses the stories, and while past volumes could contain sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, or twenty-one stories, the number has settled at twenty. Starting in 1997, a jury of three writers was convened by the series editor to determine the first-, second-, and third-prize winners, but in 2003, the rankings were eliminated and all the winners are now equally honored. The three jurors now read a blind manuscript separately; each chooses a single favorite and writes about it. This avoids decisions by committee and also makes the process more fun for the jurors since they don&#x2019;t know who wrote the story or where it was published. Only twice in sixteen years has a story been recognized by a juror.<br><br>Looking back at the O. Henry Prize&#x2019;s beginning decades, other differences jump out at one. Originally, most of the stories chosen for the collection were by white, male writers, though occasionally O. Henry readers could enjoy the likes of Dorothy Parker, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor. Over the years, the O. Henry has become more welcoming of different voices. So long as a story was originally composed in English it is eligible for consideration, no matter the nationality of the author. So long as a magazine is distributed in North America, it is welcome to submit stories to the&nbsp;O. Henry. As a result, the annual collection is increasingly international. Readers will find that the 2019 collection offers stories from a variety of writers and set all over the world, from Maui to the American West, from New York to Laos to the east bank of the river Jordan. The magazines that published the stories in the present collection range from the venerable <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Kenyon Review</i>, and <i>Sewanee Review </i>to small magazines such as <i>LitMag </i>(in its second year of publication), <i>A Public Space</i>, and <i>ZYZZYVA</i>. Not all submitting publications are print ones; for instance, there&#x2019;s a story this year from <i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s online incarnation, Granta.com.<br><br> With all the changes the decades have brought, there is a consistent goal: to find exemplary stories and to celebrate the short story form. It&#x2019;s been my privilege to be part of the O. Henry&#x2019;s history since the 2003, and editing the anniversary edition has been as exciting as ever. In its hundredth year, <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories </i>is alive, well, and faithful to its original purpose&#x2014;to strengthen the art of the short story.<br><br>&#x2014;Laura Furman, Series Editor</p><h2>The Trojan War: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p><em>The Iliad,</em> Homer's epic tale of the abduction of Helen and the decade-long Trojan War, has fascinated mankind for millennia. Even today, the war inspires countless articles and books, extensive archaeological excavations, movies, television documentaries, even souvenirs and collectibles. But while the ancients themselves believed that the Trojan War took place, scholars of the modern era have sometimes derided it as a piece of fiction. <br><br>Combining archaeological data and textual analysis of ancient documents, this Very Short Introduction considers whether or not the war actually took place and whether archaeologists have really discovered the site of ancient Troy. To answer these questions, archaeologist and ancient historian Eric H. Cline examines various written sources, including the works of Homer, the <em>Epic Cycle</em> (fragments from other, now-lost Greek epics), classical plays, and Virgil's <em>Aeneid.</em> Throughout, the author tests the literary claims against the best modern archaeological evidence, showing for instance that Homer, who lived in the Iron Age, for the most part depicted Bronze Age warfare with accuracy. Cline also tells the engaging story of the archaeologists--Heinrich Schliemann and his successors Wilhelm D�rpfeld, Carl Blegen, and Manfred Korfmann--who found the long-vanished site of Troy through excavations at Hisarlik, Turkey. <br><br>Drawing on evidence found at Hisarlik and elsewhere, Cline concludes that a war or wars in the vicinity of Troy probably did take place during the Late Bronze Age, forming the nucleus of a story that was handed down orally for centuries until put into final form by Homer. But Cline suggests that, even allowing that a Trojan War took place, it probably was not fought because of Helen's abduction, though such an incident may have provided the justification for a war actually fought for more compelling economic and political motives.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

He moved without haste. He&#x2019;d arrived early, and the boat he&#x2019;d come to meet was nowhere in sight.</p><p>At the end of the dock, trash from three countries&#x2014;China and the two Koreas&#x2014;bobbed in the dank water, the eastern edge of the Yellow Sea. The air was heavy with smoke from the ships that docked at Incheon every day to load up on cars and televisions for the United States. The sun had baked the fumes into a brown smog that burned Beck&#x2019;s throat and made him want a cigarette.</p><p>He fished a packet of Camel Lights from his pocket and lit up. He&#x2019;d tried to quit over the years. But if he was going to sign up for missions like this one, what was the point? He smoked slowly and when he was done flicked the butt away. It spun into the harbor, joining the empty beer cans and condom wrappers.</p><p>Then he heard the low rumble of a boat engine.</p><p>Incheon was an industrial port fifty miles west of Seoul and a few miles south of the Demilitarized Zone, the strip that separated North and South Korea. During the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur had landed here, cutting behind North Korean lines to stop the Communist advance.</p><p>A statue of him stood atop a hill not far from this pier. Binoculars in hand, the general looked out to the Yellow Sea, which separated China and the Korean Peninsula. This afternoon, Beck would head into those waters, on a mission smaller than MacArthur&#x2019;s assault but just as dangerous.</p><p>The rumble of the distant boat grew louder. Beck pulled his wallet out of his pocket, a battered piece of cowhide that had seen him through thirty-two countries and three counterinsurgencies. He wasn&#x2019;t carrying any identification or a passport, just money. About $3,000 in all. And three pictures: his wife and their two sons. He took out the pictures and kissed them.</p><p>Then he flicked his lighter to them and watched them burn, holding them as long as he could, until the flames singed his fingers and he had to let them go. Their remnants sank into the water and drifted away.</p><p>Beck carried out the same ritual before every mission, for reasons both practical and superstitious. If he was caught, the photographs would give his captors a psychological edge. More important, burning the pictures was his way of accepting the danger of the mission. When he came back, he&#x2019;d put fresh copies in his wallet. Until the next time.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>THE MESSAGE HAD COME IN</b> twelve days before, to a signals-intelligence station at Camp Bonifas, on the edge of the Demilitarized Zone. The six hundred Americans and South Koreans who lived at Bonifas stayed on alert twenty-four hours a day, knowing they would be the world&#x2019;s tripwire if the North Korean army came over the DMZ. As they waited, they monitored the North&#x2019;s airwaves, listening for messages from American spies across the border.</p><p>To the officers at the Bonifas station, the transmission was gibberish, a twenty-two-second series of 1s and 0s. But they knew it meant something, for it came in on a shortwave frequency reserved for the highest-priority messages. They forwarded it around the world to Fort Meade, Maryland, the headquarters of the National Security Agency. From Fort Meade, the message, now decoded, took a shorter trip, across the Potomac to a seventh-floor office at CIA headquarters.</p><p>There it caused Vinny Duto, the director of the CIA, to unleash a few uncoded curses of his own. For the message was short, simple&#x2014;and unwelcome. The Drafter wanted out of the Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea, the country-sized prison commonly called North Korea. Immediately if not sooner.</p><p>The Drafter&#x2019;s real name was Sung Kwan. Dr. Sung Kwan. He was a scientist in North Korea&#x2019;s nuclear program, and by far the most important asset the United States had in North Korea. &#x201c;Asset&#x201d; was a rather clinical way to describe Sung, who was after all a person, not a spy satellite or a well-placed bug. But the term was fitting. For Sung had told the United States exactly where the North Koreans held their nuclear weapons&#x2014;information that was priceless.</p><p>Most analysts outside the CIA thought that North Korea hid its nukes in caves, hoping to keep them safe from an American airstrike. They were wrong. In fact, the nukes were kept in a warehouse in Pyongyang, North Korea&#x2019;s capital. The Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, wanted them close by, protected by the same army regiment that provided his personal security.</p><p>Now the USS <i>Lake Champlain,</i> a guided missile cruiser in the Sea of Japan, had a dozen Tomahawk missiles targeted on the building. If the order came, the Tomahawks could turn the warehouse into rubble in minutes. All thanks to Sung. And now he wanted an emergency exfiltration. No wonder Vinny Duto was upset.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>SUNG WAS A CAREFUL SPY.</b> He had met American agents only three times, each time in Pakistan,...</p></p><h2>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Applause Libretto Library)</h2><p>Book by Hugh Wheeler<br><br>Introduction by Christopher Bond<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Sondheim fearlessly explores psychic caverns where civilized people are not dying to go ...

Praised as "radiant with maxims to live by" in <i>The New York Times Book Review </i>and "accessible, reliable and comprehensive" in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>What to Eat </i>is an indispensable resource, packed with important information and useful advice from the acclaimed nutritionist who "has become to the food industry what . . . Ralph Nader [was] to the automobile industry" (<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>).</p><p>How we choose which foods to eat is growing more complicated by the day, and the straightforward, practical approach of <i>What to Eat </i>has been praised as welcome relief. As Nestle takes us through each supermarket section&#x2015;produce, dairy, meat, fish&#x2015;she explains the issues, cutting through foodie jargon and complicated nutrition labels, and debunking the misleading health claims made by big food companies. With Nestle as our guide, we are shown how to make wise food choices&#x2015;and are inspired to eat sensibly and nutritiously.</p><p>Now in paperback, <i>What to Eat </i>is already a classic&#x2015;"the perfect guidebook to help navigate through the confusion of which foods are good for us" (<i>USA Today</i>).</p></p><p>How do we choose what to eat? Buffeted by health claims--should we, for example, restrict our intake of carbs or fats or both? Is organic food better for us?--we become confused and tune out. In supermarkets we buy semi-consciously, unaware that our choices are carefully orchestrated by sophisticated marketing strategies concerned only with the bottom line. That we should confront such persuasion is the major point made by nutritionist-consumer advocate Marion Nestle in her extraordinary <i>What to Eat</i>, an aisle-by-aisle guide to supermarket buying and thus an anatomy of American food business. "The way food is situated in today's society discourages healthful food choices," Nestle tells us, a fact that finds literal representation in our supermarkets, where food placement--dependant on "slotting fees," guaranteed advertising and other incentives--determines every purchase we make. <p> Nestle walks readers through every supermarket section--produce, meat, fish, dairy, packaged foods, bottled waters, and more--decoding labels and clarifying nutritional and other claims (in supermarket-speak, for example, "fresh" means most likely to spoil first, not recently picked or prepared), and in so doing explores issues like the effects of food production on our environment, the way pricing works, and additives and their effect on nutrition. </p><p> What Nestle reveals is both discouraging and empowering. Through ubiquitous advertising, almost universal food availability, the growth of portion size, and unchecked marketing to kids, we&#x2019;re encouraged to eat more than we need, with consequent negative impact on our health. Knowledge is indeed power, and Nestle's lively, witty, and thoroughly enlightening book--the work, readers quickly see, of a food lover intent on increasing sensual satisfaction at table as well as promoting health--will help its readers become completely cognizant about food shopping. It's a must for anyone who eats and buys food and wants to do both better. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><p><b>Marion Nestle</b> is the most respected nutritionist in America today.

It explores two interrelated dimensions of learning leadership: the ways leaders themselves learn about leadership practice, and the way leaders foster the learning of those they work with. The book focuses on a number of important leadership activities and adopts a case study approach to illuminate how leaders themselves learn, how they impart knowledge to others, and how they support others in becoming more effective and enduring learners.</p><p><p>Praise for Learning As a Way of Leading</p> <p>"If the movement for social justice education is going to successfully institutionalize, it will require skillful and talented leadership. Stephen Preskill and Stephen Brookfield have given us a morally compelling picture of what organic leadership for educational change might look like and how it can be developed. This book deserves to be widely read and thought about." &#x2015;Charles Payne, Frank B. Hixon Professor, School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, and author, I've Got the Light of Freedom: The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle</p> <p>"Leadership for substantive change is rooted in deep learning. This important book never fails to inspire its readers with ample evidence in theory and practice." &#x2015;Richard Guarasci, coauthor, Democratic Education in an Age of Difference, and president,Wagner College</p> <p>"Several elements of this book make it a most welcome addition to leadership studies. First, and most obvious, is the emphasis on learning; a relief from the still lingering emphasis on leadership as authority and expertise. Second, the authors&#x2015;with their extensive background in critical thinking, adult learning, and democratic pedagogy&#x2015;explain specific types of learning that would serve all leaders well regardless of context. Third, they ground these types of learning in the work of specific people who championed democratic, just, peaceful, and sustainable societies; an important group for leadership studies. Finally, the authors model what they preach. They lead us to new insights through the learning processes and people they describe in hopes that what they have learned will help us more fully realize ourselves as human beings first and only then, as leaders." &#x2015;Richard Couto, professor, Leadership and Change Ph.D. program, Antioch University, and senior fellow, James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership, University of Maryland</p><p>Learning As a Way of Leading</p> <p>Learning As a Way of Leading explores a little-researched form of leadership study&#x2014;social activism. In this groundbreaking book, Stephen Preskill and Stephen D. Brookfield take an in-depth look at how social justice leaders learn, how they support other people's learning, and how this deepens their social impact.</p> <p>As the authors explain, the best leaders enjoy a capacity to be taught, to work collaboratively with followers, to listen and learn from people around them, and, in many cases, to lead by being led. Such leaders are developmental leaders, chiefly interested in drawing out the abilities and capacities of their followers. They do this by remaining open to what those followers can impart to them as much as by guiding them to new possibilities.</p> <p>Learning As a Way of Leading focuses on a number of important leadership tasks such as publicly modeling engagement in learning, viewing learning as a daily professional imperative, and communicating to colleagues the lessons learned. To demonstrate each of these activities, the book includes portraits of nine twentieth-century leaders&#x2014;Jane Addams, Nelson Mandela, Septima Clark, Ella Baker, Myles Horton, Aldo Leopold, Mary Parker Follett, Paul Robeson, and Cesar Chavez&#x2014;who exemplify the learning tasks identified in this pioneering resource. Each of the noteworthy leaders supported their co-workers in challenging the status quo, in expanding the boundaries of what can be accomplished together, and in raising standards of what we expect from each other, both intellectually and morally.</p> <p>Learning As a Way of Leading is an essential resource written for anyone who wants to make a difference for the public good by joining with others to bring about positive change.</p></p>
